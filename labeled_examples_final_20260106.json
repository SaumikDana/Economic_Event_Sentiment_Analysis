    "Press Releases\nQuarterly Refunding Statement Of Acting Assistant Secretary For Financial Markets Monique Rollins\nAugust 2, 2017\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury is offering $62 billion of Treasury securities to refund approximately $47.3 billion of privately-held Treasury notes maturing on August 15, 2017.  This will raise new cash of approximately $14.7 billion.  The securities are:\n\n-        A 3-year note in the amount of $24 billion, maturing August 15, 2020;\n\n-        A 10-year note in the amount of $23 billion, maturing August 15, 2027; and\n\n-        A 30-year bond in the amount of $15 billion, maturing August 15, 2047.\n\nThe 3-year note will be auctioned on a yield basis at 1:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, August 8, 2017.  The 10-year note will be auctioned on a yield basis at 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, August 9, 2017.  The 30-year bond will be auctioned on a yield basis at 1:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, August 10, 2017.  All of these auctions will settle on Tuesday, August 15, 2017.\n\nThe balance of Treasury financing requirements will be met with the weekly bill auctions, cash management bills, the monthly note and bond auctions, the August 5-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) reopening auction, the September 10-year TIPS reopening auction, the October 30-year TIPS reopening auction, and the regular monthly 2-year Floating Rate Note (FRN) auctions.\n\nProjected Financing Needs\n\nBased on current fiscal forecasts, Treasury intends to maintain coupon issuance sizes at current levels over the upcoming quarter.  Treasury will continue to monitor projected financing needs and make appropriate adjustments as necessary.  Treasury plans to address changes in any seasonal borrowing needs over the next quarter through changes in regular bill auction sizes and/or cash management bills.\n\nDebt Limit\n\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 suspended the debt limit through March 15, 2017.  Since that time, Treasury has been at the debt limit and has been taking extraordinary measures to finance the government on a temporary basis. Based upon available information, Treasury expects to be able to fund the government through the end of September. It is critical that Congress act to increase the nation’s borrowing authority, and Treasury urges Congress to act promptly on this important matter.\n\nFinancing System Open Market Account (SOMA) Portfolio Redemptions\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) June statement and Addendum to the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans signaled expectations for gradual future changes in the Federal Reserve’s reinvestment policy for its SOMA portfolio.  These will affect Treasury’s net marketable borrowing from the public over the coming years.  Specifically, Treasury will need to increase the amount of borrowing from other investors in order to fund these SOMA redemptions.  Treasury will likely respond to the additional borrowing needs associated with SOMA redemptions by increasing both Treasury bill and Treasury nominal coupon auction sizes, beginning with bills and then coupons, as appropriate.\n\nIf and when the timing of the Federal Reserve’s start to SOMA redemptions becomes available, Treasury will provide market participants with further guidance regarding changes to future auction sizes.\n\nPlease send comments and suggestions on these subjects or others related to debt management.  The next quarterly refunding announcement will take place on November 1, 2017.\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nTop Economists Agree: Tax Reform Will Lead to Substantial Economic Growth\nNovember 27, 2017\nWashington – Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin received a letter Saturday from nine of the nation’s leading economists addressing the implications of tax reform for economic growth.",
    "Testimonies\nStatement of Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin Before the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means\nFebruary 15, 2018\nChairman Brady, Ranking Member Neal, and members of the Committee, it is good to be here with you today.\n\nAs Treasury Secretary, I am focused on advancing the President’s policies that will bring prosperity to the American people through economic growth. This is a core focus of the President, and he is delivering. Last year, the economy had two straight quarters of three percent or higher GDP growth, and the growth rate was higher than the average over the previous twenty years.\n\nThe cornerstone of returning to more robust growth is deregulation and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This law is already providing relief to middle-income families by putting money directly back into the pockets of hardworking American families.\n\nSince the law was enacted, over 350 companies have announced bonuses, wage increases, higher 401(k) matches, and new hiring, benefiting more than 4 million employees. We are seeing the fastest wage growth since 2009 at 2.9%.\n\nThis is a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of American families.\n\nOur reforms are making America’s companies competitive again, which is having a demonstrable effect on the economic success of the nation. The Act lowered the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% – the highest in the industrial world – to 21%, below the industrial average. It also encourages companies to bring back the profits they have sitting overseas by eliminating the tax incentive for keeping that money offshore.\n\nTurning to the budget, the Fiscal Year 2019 Budget reflects last year’s tax reform legislation, which reduces the burden on taxpayers and sets the country up for long-term growth. The policies in this budget will drive down spending and grow the economy, which are both critical to putting the nation on a sound fiscal path over the long term and reducing the budget deficit as a share of GDP.\n\nThe past year has been an important step forward for our country. We will continue this progress by enacting policies that enable the American people to succeed, and I look forward to continuing to work with Congress to make this happen.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n####",
    "Press Releases\nTreasury, IRS Announce First Round Of Opportunity Zones Designations For 18 States\nApril 9, 2018\nWashington –The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) today designated Opportunity Zones in 18 States. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created Opportunity Zones to spur investment in distressed communities throughout the country. New investments in Opportunity Zones can receive preferential tax treatment.\n\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, States, D.C., and U.S. possessions nominate low-income communities to be designated as Qualified Opportunity Zones, which are eligible for the tax benefit.  States were required by March 21st to submit nominations or request a 30 day extension to submit nominations. Treasury has 30 days from the date of submission to designate the nominated zones. Treasury today has designated the nominations of all States that submitted by the March 21st deadline.  Treasury will make future designations as submissions by the states that have requested an extension are received and certified.\n\n“I am very excited about the prospects for Opportunity Zones. Attracting needed private investment into these low-income communities will lead to their economic revitalization, and ensure economic growth is experienced throughout the nation,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “The Administration will continue working with States and the private sector to encourage investment and development in Opportunity Zones and other economically disadvantaged areas and boost economic growth and job creation.”\n\nSubmissions were approved today for: American Samoa; Arizona; California; Colorado; Georgia; Idaho; Kentucky; Michigan; Mississippi; Nebraska; New Jersey; Oklahoma; Puerto Rico; South Carolina; South Dakota; Vermont; Virgin Islands; and Wisconsin.  \n\nQualified Opportunity Zones retain this designation for 10 years. Investors can defer tax on any prior gains until no later than December 31, 2026, so long as the gain is reinvested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund, an investment vehicle organized to make investments in Qualified Opportunity Zones.  In addition, if the investor holds the investment in the Opportunity Fund for at least ten years, the investor would be eligible for an increase in its basis equal to the fair market value of the investment on the date that it is sold.\n\nTreasury and the IRS plan to issue additional information on Qualified Opportunity Funds.  The additional guidance will address the certification of Opportunity Funds, which are required to have at least 90 percent of fund assets invested in Opportunity Zones.\n\nView designated Opportunity Zones.\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nTreasury, IRS Announce Development of Postcard-Size Form 1040 for 2019\nJune 29, 2018\nWashington— Delivering on the promise to simplify taxes for the American people, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) today announced that Americans will be able to fill out their individual income tax returns on a single postcard-size form for the 2019 tax season.\n\nThe 2018 IRS Form 1040 will replace the current Form 1040, as well as the Form 1040A and the Form 1040EZ.  The IRS circulated a copy of the new form and will work with the tax community to finalize the streamlined Form 1040 over the summer.\n\n“As part of the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this Administration committed to making taxes simple and fair for American families. We are delivering on this promise,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “The new, postcard-size Form1040 is designed to simplify and expedite filing tax returns, providing much-needed relief to hardworking taxpayers.”\n\nThis simplified Form 1040 will streamline tax returns so that all 150 million taxpayers can use the same form. The new form consolidates the three versions of the 1040 into one simple form. The IRS will still obtain the information from each taxpayer needed to determine their tax liability or refund.\n\n###",

Mnuchin.  “Taxpayers are seeing an average of $3,125 per refund, a significant return for hardworking Americans across the country.”\n\nThe number of returns filed and the average refund are substantially similar to IRS statistics from the first four weeks of the 2019 filing season.  The data released today includes refunds due to Earned Income Tax Credits and Child Tax Credits, which were held until February 15 due to the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act.\n\nView the data.\n\n####",
    "Secretary Statements & Remarks\nStatement of Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin Before the Financial Services Committee on September 22, 2020\nSeptember 22, 2020\nChairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, and members of the Committee, I am pleased to join you today to update you on how the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have been partnering over the last six months to provide relief for American workers and liquidity to credit markets, businesses, non-profit organizations, state and local governments, and households. We are fully committed to getting every American back to work as quickly as possible.\n\nAmerica is in the midst of the fastest economic recovery from any crisis in U.S. history. The August jobs report showed that the economy has gained back 10.6 million jobs since April— nearly 50% of all jobs lost due to the pandemic. The unemployment rate has also decreased to 8.4%, a notable achievement considering some people were expecting up to 25% unemployment at the height of the pandemic. Thanks to the programs provided through the CARES Act, we never got close to that figure.\n\nI believe we will see tremendous third-quarter growth, fueled by strong retail sales, housing starts and existing home sales, manufacturing growth, and increased business activity. The September Blue Chip survey increased its projection for third-quarter GDP growth by 5.3 percentage points to 24%.\n\nThe recovery has been strong because the Administration and Congress worked together on a bipartisan basis to deliver the largest economic relief package in American history. The Federal Reserve has also been instrumental to the recovery by implementing 13 unique 13(3) lending facilities.\n\nEconomic reopenings, combined with the CARES Act, have enabled a remarkable economic rebound, but some industries particularly hard hit by the pandemic require additional relief.\n\nThe President and I remain committed to providing support for American workers and businesses. We continue to try to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis to pass a Phase IV relief package. I believe a targeted package is still needed, and the Administration is ready to reach a bipartisan agreement.\n\nTreasury has been working hard to implement the CARES Act with transparency and accountability. We have released a significant amount of information to the public on our website, Treasury.gov, and on USAspending.gov. In many instances, we have released more information than what is required by the statute. The Federal Reserve has also posted information on its website regarding its lending facilities.\n\nWe have provided regular updates to Congress, with this marking my sixth appearance before Congress for a CARES Act hearing. Additionally, we are cooperating with various oversight bodies, including the new Special Inspector General for Pandemic Relief, the Treasury Inspector General, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the new Congressional Oversight Commission, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\n\nWe appreciate Congress’s interest in these issues and have devoted significant resources to responding to inquiries from numerous congressional committees and individual Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. We remain committed to working with you to accommodate Congress’s legislative needs and to further our whole-of-government approach to defeating COVID-19.\n\nI would like to thank the members of the Committee for working with us to provide critical economic support to the American people. I am pleased to answer any questions you may have.",
    "Readouts\nREADOUT: Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen’s Meeting with a Bi-Partisan Group of Mayors\nFebruary 3, 2021\nSecretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen participated in a virtual discussion with a bi-partisan group of mayors to discuss the unprecedented public health and economic crises that have left millions of Americans struggling to get by, as well as specific challenges facing cities across the country.\n\nThe Secretary highlighted the merits of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which includes $350 billion for state and local governments to do important work like distributing the vaccine and reopening schools to help cities and their citizens make it to the other side of this pandemic. She emphasized the importance of providing flexible aid to cities, so that residents would have access to critical services and mayors could ensure that first-responders, teachers, and other public-sector workers could keep their jobs. The Secretary highlighted the merits of the Child Tax Credit as a lifeline for families buckling under the weight of the pandemic, higher Economic Impact Payments, expanded and well-targeted rental assistance to prevent evictions, and boosting nutritional support to ameliorate the growing hunger crisis in our country. She also discussed the importance of investment in equitable growth, access to capital for institutions that invest in underserved communities, and accessible and equitable Paycheck Protection Program aid for small businesses impacted by the pandemic.\n\nSecretary Yellen made clear the imperative of a comprehensive package designed to help Americans weather the pandemic. She noted the benefits of acting now – and acting big – will far outweigh the costs over the long term, and expressed concern over the number of state and local workers who had lost their jobs in 2020. Secretary Yellen reiterated that a major lesson of the last recession was that the federal government didn’t provide enough aid to states and localities resulting in  sharp cuts in crucial things like infrastructure and education--which ultimately led to a weaker labor market and undercut the broader economic recovery.\n\nThe Secretary was joined by a bipartisan group of six U.S. mayors from around the country, representing a diversity of regions of the country, macroeconomic indicators, and demographics.",
    "Press Releases\nTreasury Establishes New Office to Lead Implementation of Relief and Recovery Programs\nApril 14, 2021\nWASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the establishment of the Office of Recovery Programs to lead the Department’s implementation of economic relief and recovery programs, including nearly $420 billion in programs from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. This new office, which will be led by the Chief Recovery Officer, will report to Treasury’s Deputy Secretary and will be principally focused on efficiently establishing and administering Treasury’s programs to support an equitable and swift recovery from the economic challenges precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Office’s inaugural Chief Recovery Officer is Jacob Leibenluft, who will serve as the lead administrator of recovery programs and the principal advisor to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary on recovery program implementation. The Chief Recovery Officer and staff of the Office will work closely with Gene Sperling, the White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator and Senior Advisor to President Biden.\n\n“A new, cohesive model for recovery program implementation at Treasury will help get relief distributed quickly and into the hands of those who need it most,” said Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo. “Already we are getting individual payments out the door faster and in greater volume than ever before. We hope to continue this improved delivery, while also supporting outreach between Treasury and important stakeholders across the country. We are thrilled that Jacob is willing to take on this portfolio. He has remarkable policy expertise to bring to these programs, and I’m confident that Americans will benefit from his dedication.”\n\n“I am honored to take on this role and look forward to the opportunity to support equity, transparency, and accountability in the implementation of these programs,” said Chief Recovery Officer Jacob Leibenluft. “Treasury will continue to work around the clock to engage with stakeholders, understand the needs in communities across the country, and swiftly implement relief for those who need it most.”\n\nThe Office of Recovery Programs will oversee programs authorized through the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, and the American Rescue Plan Act, as well as other legislation. These programs include the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund, Emergency Rental Assistance, the Homeowner Assistance Fund, the State Small Business Credit Initiative, the Capital Projects Fund, the Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services (CERTS) Program, the Payroll Support Program, the Coronavirus Relief Fund and the Airline and National Security Loan Program.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Office of Recovery Programs, this work was led from disparate offices across the Treasury Department. The Office of Recovery Programs will build on that work and establish a sustainable model for efficiently and effectively implementing these programs that will make it easier for communities, businesses, and households to access relief.\n\nThe implementation of the recovery programs disbursed through the tax code, including Economic Impact Payments and the enhanced Child Tax Credit, will continue to be led by the Office of Tax Policy, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Bureau of Fiscal Service, in coordination with the Office of Recovery Programs.\n\nWhile the Office of Recovery Programs is established, potential stakeholders can reach out to OfficeOfRecoveryPrograms@treasury.gov.\n\n####",
    "Readouts\nREADOUT: Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo’s Roundtable Discussion with Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Board of Directors\nApril 21, 2021\nToday, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo met virtually with members of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Board of Directors for a roundtable discussion that addressed the importance of establishing strong public-private partnerships to address the challenges facing Americans. SIFMA is a trade association for broker-dealers, investment banks, and asset managers operating in the United States and global capital markets. SIFMA serves as an industry coordinating body to promote fair and orderly markets, informed regulatory compliance, and efficient market operations and resiliency.\n\nDeputy Secretary Adeyemo discussed the American Jobs Plan, which will create millions of good-paying jobs, rebuild infrastructure, and position the United States for a successful recovery and a growth trajectory. He stressed how President Biden’s Jobs Plan will invest in the United States workforce and strengthen our job market to restore American competitiveness abroad. The Deputy Secretary also discussed President Biden’s Made in America Tax Plan, and how the proposal rewards work, not wealth. The Deputy Secretary noted that the goal of the Made in America Tax Plan is to make American companies and workers more competitive by eliminating incentives to offshore investment, substantially reducing profit shifting, countering tax competition on corporate rates, and providing tax preferences for clean energy production. He also discussed how the tax plan would generate new funding to pay for a sustained increase in investments in infrastructure, research, and support for manufacturing, fully paying for the investments in the American Jobs Plan.\n\nDeputy Secretary Adeyemo discussed the Treasury Department’s review of United States economic and financial sanctions, which have become the tool of first resort to address a range of national security, foreign policy, and economic challenges. He explained that while this tool has resulted in notable successes, it has also created unanticipated challenges. The Deputy Secretary stressed that moving forward, and as the United States faces a changing international order, the Treasury Department is assessing the costs and benefits of sanctions use in each case with an eye towards ensuring they remain a strong, viable option for policymakers in the years and decades to come. Finally, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo noted that the sanctions review will seek to ensure that the Department’s implementation and enforcement of sanctions are relevant, rigorous, and fit to purpose, while advancing United States goals.\n\n###",
    "Statements & Remarks\nStatement by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen on the American Families Plan\nApril 28, 2021\nTonight, President Biden placed education and caregiving squarely where they should be in our national discussion – as core elements of a strong economy. \n \nHistorically, childcare and other social programs to help families haven’t been seen as crucial investments underpinning American growth and productivity.  But this is a failure of perspective.  \n \nA healthy U.S. economy requires a vibrant labor market with high rates of participation. Raising U.S. rates of participation to levels comparable to those of other advanced nations  requires widespread change in our labor policies. Indeed, there are many reasons for why  U.S. labor force participation lags,  but an undeniable one is the lack of support for people as they raise children and care for older relatives.  Funding policies that help children and families will boost labor force participation and productivity, resulting in an improvement in the standard of living.  \n \nThis is the President’s vision: To recognize that our work lives – and our family lives – are inextricably linked, and if we want to improve one, then we must improve the other. \n \nThe President pays for these investments by addressing another historic challenge: the country’s unfair tax code. Over the next decade, the American people are expected to lose out on $7 trillion in revenue, in large part because some of the highest earners aren’t reporting their actual income. In addition to strengthening  compliance, the plan will also close capital gains loopholes and treat investment earnings the same as wages for high-income taxpayers. \n \nA fairer tax code in exchange for a higher quality of life for most American families? There are some economic trade-offs that are tough calls. This is not one of them.\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nMore than 1.1 million additional Economic Impact Payments disbursed under the American Rescue Plan; payments total approximately 164 million\nMay 5, 2021\nWASHINGTON — Today, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service announced they are disbursing more than 1.1 million payments in the eighth batch of Economic Impact Payments from the American Rescue Plan.\n\nToday’s announcement brings the total disbursed so far to approximately 164 million payments, with a total value of approximately $386 billion, since these payments began rolling out to Americans in batches as announced on March 12.\n\nThe eighth batch of payments began processing on Friday, April 30, with an official payment date of May 5, with some people receiving direct payments in their accounts earlier as provisional or pending deposits. Here is additional information on this batch of payments:\n\nAdditional information is available on the first seven batches of Economic Impact Payments from the American Rescue Plan, which processed weekly on April 23, April 16, April 9, April 2, March 26, March 19 and March 12.\n\nThe IRS will continue to make Economic Impact Payments on a weekly basis. Ongoing payments will be sent to eligible individuals for whom the IRS previously did not have information to issue a payment but who recently filed a tax return, as well to people who qualify for “plus-up” payments.\n\nSpecial reminder for those who don't normally file a tax return\n\nAlthough payments are automatic for most people, the IRS continues to urge people who don’t normally file a tax return and haven’t received Economic Impact Payments to file a 2020 tax return to get all the benefits they’re entitled to under the law, including tax credits such as the 2020 Recovery Rebate Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Filing a 2020 tax return will also assist the IRS in determining whether someone is eligible for an advance payment of the 2021 Child Tax Credit, which will begin to be disbursed this summer.\n\nFor example, some federal benefits recipients may need to file a 2020 tax return – even if they don't usually file – to provide information the IRS needs to send payments for a qualifying dependent. Eligible individuals in this group should file a 2020 tax return as quickly as possible to be considered for an additional payment for their qualifying dependents.\n\nPeople who don't normally file a tax return and don't receive federal benefits may qualify for these Economic Impact Payments. This includes those experiencing homelessness, the rural poor, and others. Individuals who didn't get a first or second round Economic Impact Payment or got less than the full amounts may be eligible for the 2020 Recovery Rebate Credit, but they’ll need to file a 2020 tax return. See the special section on IRS.gov: Claiming the 2020 Recovery Rebate Credit if you aren't required to file a tax return.\n\nFree tax return preparation is available for qualifying people.\n\nThe IRS reminds taxpayers that the income levels in this third round of Economic Impact Payments have changed. This means that some people won't be eligible for the third payment even if they received a first or second Economic Impact Payment or claimed a 2020 Recovery Rebate Credit. Payments will begin to be reduced for individuals making $75,000 or above in Adjusted Gross Income ($150,000 for married filing jointly). The payments end at $80,000 for individuals ($160,000 for married filing jointly); people with Adjusted Gross Incomes above these levels are ineligible for a payment.\n\nIndividuals can check the Get My Payment tool on IRS.gov to see the payment status of these payments. Additional information on Economic Impact Payments is available on IRS.gov.\n\n###",

The call featured comments from White House and Treasury officials and a demonstration of the new tool by Code for America. The call also included a wide range of organizations that have been actively engaged in CTC outreach efforts and offered guidance on how they can help raise awareness and drive enrollments through the new tool. Leaders of grassroots organizations also spoke on the call about their shared commitment to ensuring the advance CTC reaches every possible eligible family.\n\nAdministration officials emphasized that the launch of this tool is the latest step in an all-out effort to help more Americans who do not regularly file taxes to claim their CTC. They also reiterated that while the Code for America tool is an important and necessary resource to help more families this tax season, the Administration remains committed to creating a permanent, fully resourced, multi-lingual, and mobile-friendly government sign-up tool.  This commitment is part of the Biden Administration’s efforts to extend the expanded CTC program. Officials also reiterated their commitment to working with Congress to provide the necessary funding for a multi-year effort — leveraging public sector and community-oriented solutions — to reach and sign up more families and children.\n\nTreasury and White House officials highlighted recent data showing how this monthly tax relief is already helping families with the costs of raising children – from the most basic expenses to paying dental bills, helping with afterschool and summer activities, or getting extra help for school. According the Census Household Pulse Survey, food instability among all families with children fell by 24% immediately after the first payments went out. A Columbia analysis found that low-income families with children who received the first monthly payment experienced a 43% decline in food insufficiency.\n\nThe Administration will link to the new sign-up portal – GetCTC.org – and over the coming weeks, the Administration will host dozens of navigator trainings on the new Code for American portal for public sector and community-based organizations seeking to enroll non-filers in the Child Tax Credit.",
    "Press Releases\nTreasury and IRS Disburse Fourth Month of Advance Child Tax Credit Payments\nOctober 15, 2021\nSince July, Treasury and the IRS have delivered over $61 billion dollars in direct payments to families\n\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service announced today that more than $15 billion dollars in payments were made to families that include roughly 61 million eligible children. This is the fourth monthly payment of the expanded and advanceable Child Tax Credit provided in the American Rescue Plan. Since the first payments were sent in July, Treasury and the IRS have delivered more than $61 billion dollars to families across the country. Eligible families received a payment of up to $300 per month for each child under age 6 and up to $250 per month for each child age 6 to 17.\n\n“Since July, the advance Child Tax Credit has provided monthly direct assistance to families to help them cover basic household essentials like food and childcare,” said Deputy Secretary Adewale Adeyemo. “It’s clear this tax relief is meaningfully improving the lives of children in every corner of the country, which is why Congress must act to extend it so these monthly payments don’t end after December.”\n\nWithin weeks of the first payments going out, the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey data showed that 55% of middle-income families spent their Child Tax Credit payments on food, 26 percent spent it on clothes, and 23 percent spend it on costs related to school and afterschool. A recent national survey from researchers at the Social Policy Institute found that 42% planned to use at least some of the credit to start or grow a college fund for their child and 24% planned to use their Child Tax Credit payments for childcare expenses. Researchers at the Columbia Center on Poverty and Social Policy found that the initial payments were associated with 25 percent decline in food insufficiency among low-income families with children.\n\nUnless Congress acts to extend the advance Child Tax Credit, Treasury and the IRS will deliver the final monthly payments on December 15th. Absent an extension, the families of roughly 61 million children currently benefiting from this reliable relief will face tighter monthly budgets and difficult choices to make ends meet. And the families of 26 million lower-income children who are now receiving the full credit for the first time would once again receive less than the full credit because their incomes are too low. In the meantime, non-filer families can continue to sign-up for advance Child Tax Credit payments until November 15, 2021 through Code for America’s bilingual, mobile-friendly tool. Families who successfully sign-up between now and mid-November will either receive their payments distributed between November and December, or in December as a lump sum. After November 15th, non-filer families that haven’t signed up yet can still claim their full Child Tax Credit during next year’s tax season.\n\nOver the past few months, Treasury and the White House have partnered with federal agencies, state and local governments, national organizations, and community groups to train thousands of people across the country to serve as navigators. These navigators are trusted messengers within their communities, providing approachable, hands-on expertise to non-filers. The White House and Treasury have conducted more than 40 navigator trainings to date, which provided training for more than 7,000 potential Child Tax Credit navigators in English and Spanish. The IRS also embarked on an extensive communications and education effort to reach non-filers, with a special focus on reaching underserved and non-English speaking communities. As part of this ongoing effort, the IRS hosted free tax preparation days in nearly 30 cities across the country in June and July, has participated in more than 250 partner events on CTC, developed online materials and toolkits, and in recent weeks sent letters to potential non-filers detailing how to sign up for advance payments of the Child Tax Credit and the 3rd round of Economic Impact Payments.\n\nFor a state-by-stake breakdown of Child Tax Credit payments, visit https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/Advance-CTC-Payments-Disbursed-October-2021-by-State-10142021.xlsx\n\n####",

The $2.9 billion in ERA expenditures from both ERA 1 and ERA 2 funds in November 2021 represents the largest amount of assistance paid to eligible households and the largest number of payments made in any month since the programs were created. Due to the Administration’s efforts to prevent evictions, including the significant progress shown in the implementation of ERA programs, eviction filings remain well below pre-pandemic levels. Eviction Lab data shows that in the four full months since the end of the eviction moratorium in August, eviction filings have remained below 60 percent of historical levels.\n\nTreasury’s efforts to provide grantees with additional flexibilities and highlight promising practices have helped speed up the pace at which these funds are reaching renters in need. This is the third straight month of over $2.8 billion in ERA spending and over 500,000 payments under the programs. Treasury projects that approximately $25 to $30 billion of combined ERA 1 and ERA 2 funds were spent or obligated by the end of 2021, based on the pace of spending and obligation through the end of November.\n\nThe ERA 1 statute required Treasury to begin a reallocation process on September 30, 2021, whereby “excess funds,” that are not obligated, are recaptured from grantees and reallocated to eligible grantees that obligated at least 65 percent of their total ERA1 award and have a demonstrated need for such funds.\n\nThere will be multiple rounds of ERA 1 reallocation. In this first round of reallocation, Treasury will disburse over $1.1 billion in ERA 1 funding, more than three-quarters of which are significant, one-time transfers proposed voluntarily between ERA 1 grantees in the same state. Any amounts recaptured from a grantee were first prioritized to grantees in the same state that were deemed eligible to receive reallocated funds. Funds were then distributed nationally, prioritizing grantees that had substantially completed their spending of ERA 1, with grantees that made more rapid progress on the expenditure of their ERA 2 funding weighted more heavily. The rapid utilization of ERA funds across the country meant that only a limited amount of funding would be reallocated.\n\nTreasury has now begun informing grantees about the process for requesting funding in the second round of ERA 1 reallocations.  The deadline for submitting a request for the second round of reallocated funds is January 21, 2022.  By statute, the process for reallocating ERA 2 funds will not begin until March 31, 2022, and Treasury will publish separate guidance for this reallocation.\n\nTreasury is encouraging states and localities to use other sources of funds, including the $350 billion Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds, to provide additional support to renters – as several communities are already doing. Treasury is also encouraging states and localities to continue to implement other policies and procedures to prevent evictions.\n\nFind the November 2021 Emergency Rental Assistance data here.\n\nFind more data on the first round of ERA 1 reallocation here.\n\nFind more data on the first round of ERA 1 voluntary reallocation here.\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nREADOUT: Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen’s Meeting with UnidosUS\nMarch 30, 2022\nWASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met today with President and CEO of UnidosUS Janet Murguia, members of the organization’s national leadership, and a delegation of their affiliate leaders, which included representatives from Latino advocacy organizations, to discuss how the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) is supporting the Latino community and what Treasury is doing to promote economic growth in traditionally underserved communities.\n\nSecretary Yellen thanked UnidosUS for their partnership and thoughtful input to Treasury regarding the implementation of its economic recovery programs particularly with respect to ensuring equitable access to emergency resources. Treasury has been focused on promoting equity in its housing work, including through ARP programs like the Homeowner Assistance Fund and Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program. Treasury has provided guidance that allows increased flexibility for grantees to connect directly with renters, and encouraged ERA grantees to focus on multilingual outreach and engaging those most in need. Recently released ERA data shows that over 80% of recipients are very low-income, and approximately 40% self-identify as Black and 20% as Hispanic. In 2021, Treasury and the IRS also disbursed roughly $93 billion to families in advance Child Tax Credit (CTC) payments. Treasury and its partners have made it a priority to help ensure that Latino families, Puerto Rican residents, and other eligible taxpayers receive their full CTC benefits.\n\nSecretary Yellen also discussed Treasury’s work to ensure community development financial institutions (CDFIs) have the support they need to fuel economic growth in Latino communities and provide greater access to capital to Latino entrepreneurs and small businesses. In December, Secretary Yellen announced the deployment of more than $8.7 billion in funding for CDFIs and minority depository institutions through the Emergency Capital Investment Program, and Treasury anticipates that these investments will have strong impacts in Latino communities.\n\nAttendees included:\n\n###",
    "Readouts\nREADOUT: Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo’s Visit to the Brooklyn Navy Yard\nApril 8, 2022\nNEW YORK — Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo toured the Brooklyn Navy Yard (the Yard) in New York City, a center of manufacturing and workforce innovation located across 300 acres along Brooklyn’s waterfront, and heard from local leaders, students, and small business owners about their efforts to promote equitable economic development and recovery from the pandemic. The Yard is run by the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation, which is a not-for-profit corporation whose mission is to fuel New York City’s economic vitality by creating and preserving quality jobs, growing the city’s modern industrial sector and its businesses, and connecting the local community with the economic opportunity and resources of the Yard.\n\nAt the Yard, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo visited and met with students at The Brooklyn STEAM Center, an innovative career and technical education high school that prepares 11th and 12th grade public high school students to thrive in manufacturing, technology, and creative fields. He also met with Founder Fellows – tech startup founders from underrepresented backgrounds – at New Lab, a community of hardware-centric designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs creating the next generation of responsible enterprises through advanced technologies, and visited Nanotronics, an advanced machines and intelligence company. In recent years, the Yard’s dramatic growth has been aided by federal investment; in particular, New Market Tax Credits (NMTCs) were used to finance the retrofit and buildout of multiple modern, green manufacturing buildings on the Yard.\n\nDuring his visit, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo discussed the Biden-Harris Administration’s plan to strengthen critical supply chains and invest in U.S. manufacturing and infrastructure, including by expanding access to capital for small manufacturers through the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). Nearly a quarter of funding from the last round of SSBCI supported manufacturing companies. To ensure that small manufacturers can access this program, Treasury is working with state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments to share ideas and highlight best practices.\n\nParticipants:\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nPreliminary Report on Foreign Holdings of U.S. Securities at End-June 2022\nFebruary 28, 2023\nWashington – Preliminary data from the June 2022 benchmark survey of foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities were released today on the Treasury website at https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/us-liabilities-to-foreigners-from-holdings-of-us-securities.  Final survey results, which will include additional detail as well as possible revisions to the preliminary data, will be reported on April 28, 2023.  The survey was undertaken jointly by Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  The next annual survey will cover holdings at the end of June 2023; preliminary data are expected to be released by February 29, 2024.\n\nComplementary surveys measuring U.S. holdings of foreign securities are also carried out annually.  Data from the most recent survey, reporting on securities held at year-end 2022, are currently being processed.  Preliminary results are expected to be reported by August 31, 2023.\n\nOverall Preliminary Results\n\nThe survey measured the value of foreign holdings of U.S. securities as of June 30, 2022, to be $25,282 billion, with $12,238 billion held in U.S. equities, $11,914 billion held in U.S. long-term debt securities [1] (of which $1,649 billion are holdings of asset-backed securities (ABS) [2] and $10,265 billion are holdings of non-ABS securities), and $1,130 billion held in U.S. short-term debt securities.  The previous survey, conducted as of June 30, 2021, measured the value of total foreign holdings of U.S. securities at $27,190 billion, with holdings of $13,705 billion in U.S. equities, $12,409 billion in U.S. long-term debt securities, and $1,077 billion in U.S. short-term debt securities (see Table A).\n\n[1].  Long-term debt securities have an original term-to-maturity of over one year.\n\n[2].  Asset-backed securities are backed by pools of assets, such as pools of residential home mortgages or credit card receivables, which give the security owners claims against the cash flows generated by the underlying assets.  Unlike most other debt securities, these securities generally repay both principal and interest on a regular basis, reducing the principal outstanding with each payment cycle.\n\nTable A.  Foreign holdings of U.S. securities, by type of security, as of recent survey dates\n\n(Billions of dollars)\n\nType of security\n\nJune 30, 2021\n\nJune 30, 2022\n\nLong-term securities\n\n26,114\n\n24,152\n\nEquities\n\n13,705\n\n12,238\n\nLong-term debt\n\n12,409\n\n11,914\n\nAsset-backed\n\n1,562\n\n1,649\n\nOther\n\n10,847\n\n10,265\n\nShort-term debt securities\n\n1,077\n\n1,130\n\nTotal\n\n27,190\n\n25,282\n\nOf which: Official\n\n6,471\n\n5,946\n\nTable B.  Foreign holdings of U.S. securities, by country and type of security,\n\nfor the major investing countries into the U.S., as of June 30, 2022\n\n(Billions of dollars)\n\nTotal\n\nEquities\n\nLong-term debt\n\nShort\n\nABS\n\nOther\n\n-term\n\n1\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n2,469\n\n1319\n\n132\n\n927\n\n92\n\n2\n\nJapan\n\n2,366\n\n728\n\n249\n\n1316\n\n73\n\n3\n\nCayman Islands\n\n2,313\n\n1,365\n\n107\n\n697\n\n144\n\n4\n\nLuxembourg\n\n2,096\n\n1026\n\n66\n\n874\n\n130\n\n5\n\nCanada\n\n1,850\n\n1348\n\n111\n\n371\n\n21\n\n6\n\nChina, mainland [i]\n\n1,473\n\n273\n\n242\n\n956\n\n2\n\n7\n\nIreland\n\n1,399\n\n752\n\n62\n\n403\n\n182\n\n8\n\nSwitzerland\n\n1016\n\n629\n\n21\n\n334\n\n32\n\n9\n\nBelgium\n\n874\n\n76\n\n16\n\n740\n\n41\n\n10\n\nTaiwan\n\n697\n\n100\n\n225\n\n366\n\n7\n\n11\n\nFrance\n\n636\n\n308\n\n29\n\n282\n\n18\n\n12\n\nAustralia\n\n573\n\n471\n\n13\n\n81\n\n9\n\n13\n\nSingapore\n\n560\n\n324\n\n18\n\n208\n\n11\n\n14\n\nNorway\n\n546\n\n387\n\n*\n\n158\n\n1\n\n15\n\nKorea, South\n\n536\n\n331\n\n41\n\n144\n\n20\n\n16\n\nGermany\n\n524\n\n313\n\n13\n\n190\n\n8\n\n17\n\nBermuda\n\n479\n\n127\n\n160\n\n153\n\n39\n\n18\n\nNetherlands\n\n457\n\n305\n\n16\n\n134\n\n2\n\n19\n\nHong Kong\n\n391\n\n142\n\n11\n\n215\n\n23\n\n20\n\nKuwait\n\n344\n\n241\n\n6\n\n56\n\n41\n\n21\n\nSweden\n\n337\n\n280\n\n*\n\n56\n\n1\n\n22\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\n311\n\n181\n\n2\n\n108\n\n20\n\n23\n\nBrazil\n\n245\n\n18\n\n*\n\n226\n\n1\n\n24\n\nIndia\n\n218\n\n8\n\n*\n\n206\n\n3\n\n25\n\nBritish Virgin Islands\n\n214\n\n129\n\n3\n\n73\n\n8\n\nRest of world\n\n2,358\n\n1058\n\n107\n\n991\n\n202\n\nTotal\n\n25,282\n\n12,238\n\n1,649\n\n10,265\n\n1,130\n\nof which: Foreign official\n\n5,946\n\n1,290\n\n652\n\n3,757\n\n247\n\n*  Less than $500 million but more than zero.\n\n[i].  Excludes Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, which are reported separately.",
    "Readouts\nREADOUT: Deputy Secretary Adeyemo Visits Communities Impacted by American Rescue Plan Funding Ahead of Act’s Second Anniversary\nMarch 3, 2023\nCalifornia Families Received more than $4 billion in Emergency Rental Assistance\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA – Today, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo visited communities across the Los Angeles area to see the impact of federal funding on pandemic recovery and long-term growth ahead of the second anniversary of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act. Signed into law in March 2021, the ARP has helped communities in southern California and across the country avert a deep and sustained economic downturn while laying a strong foundation for future growth.\n\nDeputy Secretary Adeyemo first joined the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce for a roundtable with business leaders and discussed ways the federal government can work together with the private sector and local leaders to maximize the impact of federal relief funding.\n \nDeputy Secretary Adeyemo then visited Ralph M. Parsons Preschool, a Los Angeles public preschool which received ARP funds through the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds program to reopen its facility during the pandemic. The SLFRF program provides state and local governments with $350 billion in flexible funding to respond to the pandemic and make long-term investments in their communities to build a stronger, more resilient and more equitable economy.\n \nLastly, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo toured Tierra del Sol, a multi-family low-income housing development located in the Canoga Park area of Los Angeles. The Emergency Rental Assistance program, funded in part by the American Rescue Plan, has provided a critical lifeline to renters, preventing a devastating wave of evictions while helping to build a nationwide rental assistance infrastructure. As of September 30, 2022, ERA programs have made over 9.7 million payments to households at risk of eviction totaling more than $30 billion, more than $4 billion of which has gone to California families. In addition to ERA resources, over $14 billion in SLFRF resources have been committed to nearly 1,800 projects to meet housing needs, over $4.5 billion of which have been committed to affordable housing development and preservation.",

    "Press Releases\nTreasury Department Announces Awards to Connect More Families and Businesses to High-Speed Internet as Part of President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda\nMay 15, 2023\nDelaware, Idaho approved to receive approximately $185.9 million under the American Rescue Plan\n\nCombined with other Administration initiatives, President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has brought affordable internet to over 17 million American households\n\nWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the approval of federal funds for multi-purpose community facility projects and broadband infrastructure projects in Delaware and Idaho under the American Rescue Plan’s Capital Projects Fund (CPF), part of President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda. A key priority of the CPF program is expanding economic opportunities and providing internet connectivity in communities with unmet needs. Already, President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has delivered affordable, high-speed internet to 17 million American households, through the CPF funded by the American Rescue Plan, and through the Affordable Connectivity Program funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\n“Digital connectivity is central to expanding economic opportunity in communities across the country,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “This funding is a key piece of the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic investments to increase access to high-speed internet for millions of Americans and provide more opportunities to fully participate in the 21st century economy.”\n\n“We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with ARPA capital funds to build a better future for the next generation of Delawareans,” said Governor Carney. “The capital projects announced today aim to expand economic opportunities for Delaware families, dedicate resources to make sure children have access to the education they deserve, and large investments in our communities – especially those hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to thank the Congressional delegation for their advocacy and look forward to seeing significant results from these investments.”\n\n“I was proud to work on provisions in the American Rescue Plan that helps those working on the front lines with Delawareans that need help the most,” said U.S. Senator Tom Carper. “From my time as Governor, I’ve worked on strengthening families, and these funds are going to improve the organizations that help uplift so many families in our state. These organizations often invest so much of their resources into their missions – whether it’s providing shelter, services for our veterans, substance abuse treatment, job training or after-school activities for children – and these funds will help them improve their facilities so they can better serve our communities.”\n\n“It’s great to see funds from the American Rescue Plan that Democrats and President Biden enacted coming to Delaware in all three counties,” said U.S Senator Chris Coons. “From job skills workshops to community programs to addressing nutritional insecurity, this announcement is making a difference in the lives of Delawareans up and down the state. I can’t wait to see all of these visions for each one of these dozens of projects become reality in the coming months and years.”\n\n“Today is a prime example of how we’re continuing to see historic investments being made in Delaware because of the American Rescue Plan Act,” said Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester. “The impact from these capital projects won’t just ensure that these organizations are able to fulfill their missions to provide critical services – from health care and mental health to job training and entrepreneurship – but will help us improve the quality of life for Delawareans in every part of our state.”\n\nThe CPF provides a total of $10 billion to states, territories, freely associated states, and Tribal governments to fund critical capital projects that enable work, education, and health monitoring. In addition to the $10 billion provided by the CPF, many governments are putting a portion of their State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) toward meeting the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of connecting every American household to affordable, reliable high-speed internet. Together, these American Rescue Plan programs and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are working in tandem with President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to close the digital divide – deploying high-speed internet to those without access and lowering costs for those who cannot afford it.\n\nIn accordance with the Treasury Department’s guidance, each state’s plan requires service providers to participate in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) new Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The Affordable Connectivity Program, funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, helps ensure that households can afford high-speed internet by providing a discount of up to $30 per month (or up to $75 per eligible household on Tribal lands). Experts estimate that nearly 40% of U.S. households are eligible for the program.\n\nTo further lower costs, President Biden and Vice President Harris announced last year that the Administration had secured commitments from 20 leading internet service providers—covering more than 80% of the U.S. population—to offer all ACP-eligible households high-speed, reliable internet plans for no more than $30 per month. As a result of this agreement and the ACP, eligible households can receive internet access at no cost and can check their eligibility and sign up at GetInternet.gov.\n\nThe Treasury Department began announcing state awards in June of last year.  To date, CPF has awarded approximately $6.5 billion for broadband, digital technology, and multi-purpose community center projects in 41 states. States estimate that the broadband investments will reach more than 1.83 million locations. The Department will continue approving state and Tribal plans on a rolling basis.\n\nThe following descriptions summarize the Idaho and Delaware plans that Treasury approved today:\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nEconomy Statement by Eric Van Nostrand, Acting Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy, for the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee July 31, 2023\nJuly 31, 2023\nThe U.S. economy continued to show resilience and strength in the second quarter of 2023.  Real GDP grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, picking up slightly from the pace in the first quarter.  Labor markets remained tight: payroll job growth was strong and unemployment rates remained near historically low levels.  Labor supply—particularly among prime-age (ages 25-54) workers—increased while labor demand cooled modestly, though high levels of job openings indicated that demand remains firm.  Although inflation remained elevated in the second quarter, it has eased over the past several months.  Measured year-over-year, headline inflation was the lowest since April 2021, reflecting a significant reduction in energy and food prices.  And while core inflation remains above the Fed’s target, price pressures on other goods have eased on balance.  Furthermore, inflation for housing rent as well as other core services has slowly eased.  While much remains uncertain, this progress indicates that a path toward a “soft landing” remains viable.\n\nEven so, the U.S. economy faces important headwinds moving into the second half of 2023.  Slowing global economic growth has weighed on demand for U.S. exports, and geopolitical shocks could renew price pressures if supply chains are further disrupted.  Indeed, unwelcome upward shocks to inflation may introduce instability to parts of the financial system and endanger that soft landing toward which the U.S. economy is currently tracking.  To date, however, most economic indicators have been encouraging. Neither GDP nor other popular business cycle indicators suggest near-term contraction.  Only two indicators—real manufacturing and trade sales and industrial production—showing weakness specific to the manufacturing sector, but all others used by the NBER for business cycle dating have shown net growth, year to date.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, real GDP growth accelerated to 2.4 percent at an annual rate, picking up from a 2.0 percent gain in the first quarter (see Table 1 - Real Gross Domestic Product).  Stronger growth in business fixed investment (BFI) drove the acceleration, along with an upturn in private inventory investment, which was partly offset by a wider net export deficit and slower, but still positive, growth in household consumption and government purchases.\n\nWe decompose GDP into four components: (1) private final domestic purchases (PDFP), the most persistent and stable components of output including personal consumption, business fixed investment, and residential investment; (2) government consumption and investment; (3) net international purchases; and (4) intermediate demand (or change in private inventories).  Examined separately, each component delivers specific information about activity in various sectors that can be useful in predicting the future path of growth.  The PDFP measure is especially telling of the private sector’s capacity to drive self-sustaining growth and as such, can signal the direction of future economic performance.  In the second quarter, real PDFP growth slowed to 2.3 percent at an annual rate but still contributed 2.0 percentage points to total GDP growth—a robust figure given our supply-side growth.\n\nFirst, we review changes in the components of PDFP.  Household consumption growth eased in the second quarter, largely reflecting a marked slowdown in demand for durable goods.  Goods consumption was led by purchases of recreational goods and vehicles, as well as gasoline and other energy goods, but purchases of motor vehicles declined in the second quarter, after a sizeable gain in the first quarter.  The rotation in spending from goods to services persisted.  Although consumption of services grew at a slower rate than in Q1, it still outpaced purchases of goods, with services adding nearly six times more to real GDP growth than goods consumption.  Services spending growth was largely due to housing and utilities, health care, and financial services and insurance—which together accounted for 1.0 percentage points of services growth.  By contrast, consumption of food services and accommodations declined for the first time since 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, business fixed investment accelerated in the second quarter, reflecting a sharp swing in spending on equipment after two consecutive quarters of decline.  The reversal in equipment spending was led by increased purchases of transportation equipment.  Investment in structures remained very strong, even after slowing by about one-third from the double-digit advances in the previous two quarters.  Businesses continued to invest heavily in manufacturing factories and—to a lesser degree—other structures, which offset declines in spending in health care, power and communications, and mining exploration.\n\nThe final component of PDFP, residential investment, continued to constrain overall GDP growth but at the same rate as in the first quarter.  Spending on other structures, a category that includes brokers’ commissions and home improvements, drove the decline.  By contrast, single-family home construction investment was positive for the first time since early 2022, while investment in multi-family buildings also increased.\n\nThe other three categories of GDP made mixed contributions to the overall expansion in the second quarter.  After two quarters of rapid growth, total government spending growth slowed significantly in the second quarter, owing to a sharp pull-back in federal non-defense consumption expenditures.  Other federal government spending growth held relatively steady, while state and local government spending growth decelerated modestly.  International trade was a net negative contributor to real GDP growth as exports of goods fell markedly amid slowing global economic growth; total imports also fell sharply, but less rapidly than did exports.  Meanwhile, the change in private inventories, which can exhibit wide swings from quarter to quarter, made a small contribution in the second quarter, adding 0.1 percentage points to growth after subtracting 2.1 percentage points from first quarter GDP growth.  The build was led by durable goods in both wholesale and manufacturing--as well as retail trade, particularly inventories of motor vehicles.\n\nThe labor market remained tight during the second quarter of 2023, even as the signs of easing which began late last year also became more noticeable (see Table 2 – Labor Market Indicators).  The pace of payroll job creation slowed to 244,000 jobs per month, down from the first quarter average of 312,000 per month.  Nonetheless, even this slower pace is more than adequate to maintain a stable rate of unemployment.  In fact, the headline unemployment rate returned in April to January’s half-century low of 3.4 percent, before edging up to 3.6 percent at the very end of the second quarter—still very near historical lows.  The ”underemployment” rate, or “U-6”—which includes those working part-time for economic reasons and those marginally-attached to the labor force—moved up to 6.9 percent at the end of the second quarter, or 0.4 percentage points above the record low of 6.5 percent set in December 2022 (series dates from January 1994).  Nonetheless, this rate is still well below the 2019 average rate of 7.2 percent.\n\nThe gap between labor supply and demand in the economy continued to narrow in the second quarter. The supply of labor consolidated gains seen in the first quarter: after moving up noticeably to 62.6 percent by the end of the first quarter, the labor force participation rate (LFPR) for all workers remained at that level throughout the second quarter.  Some groups of workers saw sizeable increases in participation, while others moved out of the labor force.  The LFPR for prime-age workers made substantial gains, rising to 83.5 percent by the end of the second quarter—a 21-year high.  Notably, the LFPR for prime-age women rose to the highest rate on record at 77.8 percent (data starts in 1948).  By contrast, participation by older workers dropped 0.3 percentage points over the second quarter, from 38.6 percent in March 2023 to 38.3 percent in June – or 2.0 percentage points below the 40.3 percent rate posted in February 2020—though the decrease is consistent with broader demographic trends.  Overall, the supply of labor has increased of late while the demand for labor has moved somewhat lower.  The number of job openings has trended down since March 2022: as of May 2023 (latest available data), there were 1.6 jobs per unemployed worker, the lowest ratio since October 2021—though still well above the pre-pandemic ratio of 1.2 vacancies per unemployed worker.  The decline in this ratio signals improvement in the balance between labor supply and demand.  Meanwhile, weekly unemployment insurance claims moved higher in the second quarter—though they remain at historically low levels.  On average, initial claims averaged 241,000 in the second quarter, up 9.5 percent from the first quarter.  Meanwhile, continuing claims were up 3.2 percent from the first quarter at 1.79 million, again near historically low levels.\n\nInflation: Inflation slowed further in the second quarter.  As measured by the consumer price index (CPI), average monthly inflation was 0.3 percent in the first quarter, dropping to 0.2 percent during the second quarter (see Table 3 – Inflation and Wage Growth Indicators).  Average monthly food inflation in the second quarter was one-third the pace in the previous quarter, partly reflecting lower prices for eggs, various meats, and dairy and related products.  Meanwhile, energy prices have been declining on net since June 2022, with energy prices falling 0.8 percent on average per month in the second quarter. The outlook for energy, however, is uncertain.  Saudi Arabia again tried to bolster oil prices in early July with an extension of production cuts through August.  Yet rising production by OPEC and non-OPEC members—for example, U.S. crude oil production is on track to hit a new record-high level in 2023—has undermined sustained price increases, as had slowing global growth and energy demand.\n\nExcluding energy and food, disinflation among other goods and services has been slow overall, given sustained upward pressure from rent of housing services.  Over the second quarter, core inflation averaged 0.3 percent per month, down from 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2023.  Core goods prices accelerated in the second quarter, related to an early-quarter surge in used car and truck prices.  However, upstream price pressures, as captured by producer and import prices, receded at faster rates in the second quarter, which may augur toward further slowing in consumer prices in coming months.  For core non-housing services, inflation slowed significantly in the second quarter—roughly one-fourth of the first quarter pace—in part due to deflationary pressures among tourism and recreation services.  Meanwhile, inflation for rent of housing services continues to exert upward pressure on core inflation, albeit at a slightly slower pace in the second quarter.  The slowing trend, which started in October 2022, may not be sustained.  Upward pressures on inflation could renew within the next year as market measures of rents have started to increase in recent months and house prices have risen steadily since early 2023.  Changes in rents and house prices are generally reflected in the CPI roughly a year later.\n\nInflation as measured by the PCE price index assigns different weights for different components and uses a different methodology in its calculation than the CPI.  Nonetheless, the drivers of both measures of inflation and the patterns in the second quarter are broadly similar.\n\nWage Growth: Measures of wage growth in the private sector increased in the second quarter, even after adjusting for inflation.  Average hourly earnings rose at a 4.7 percent annualized rate from March through June 2023, faster than pre-pandemic gains but still slower than the outsized paces registered through most of 2022.  After adjusting for inflation, real average hourly earnings increased, posting broad-based and positive annualized growth in the second quarter after easing slightly in the first quarter.  But an alternative measure of wage growth, the Employment Cost Index (ECI), suggests that wage pressures did moderate in the second quarter.  Over the four quarters through the second quarter of 2023, the ECI for private sector wages and salaries was slower by more than a full percentage point than the rate over the previous four quarters.  Wage growth in goods-producing industries slowed dramatically in the second quarter, while that in service-producing industries was stable relative to the first quarter at an elevated rate.  The ECI controls for employment shares among industries and occupations, making it a better reference for wage growth.\n\nThe current cycle of interest rate increases has weighed noticeably on housing market activity.  Even so, signs of stabilization began appearing in the first quarter of 2023 and persisted into the second quarter—with some metrics suggesting the sector has turned.  For example, the National Association of Homebuilders’ confidence index has improved consistently since December.  Moreover, the survey started signaling a favorable outlook in June 2023 for the first time since mid-2022.\n\nNew Residential Construction: On balance, new home construction was positive in the second quarter, but demand appeared to be diverging between the single-family and multi-family sectors (see Table 4 – Housing Market Indicators).  New single-family home construction continued to firm, given low inventories of existing homes available for sale.  Growth of single-family building permits—which precede future single-family construction—remained strong in the second quarter, growing slightly faster than in the first quarter.  The decline in multi-family permits continued, however.  Reversing the pattern in the previous quarter, growth in single-family starts was robust and offset a decline in the volatile multi-family sector.\n\nNonetheless, the multi-family sector is poised for future growth: the backlog of new multi-family units (those authorized but not started) remains at an elevated level, roughly 70 percent higher than at the end of 2020.  As a share of the total residential construction backlog, the multifamily sector accounted for roughly half, up from roughly 40 percent in mid-2021.  Moreover, although the total inventory of homes under construction declined modestly in the first and second quarters, the number of multi-family units under construction continued to climb, reaching a fresh record high in the second quarter; and completions for multi-family homes rose further above pre-pandemic norms.\n\nHomes Sales and Inventories: After growing solidly in the first quarter, sales of total existing homes declined in the second quarter and were also down by nearly 20 percent over the year ending in June 2023. Moreover, the number of existing homes available for sale fell by nearly 7 percent over the year ending the second quarter—well below similar time periods before the pandemic and suggesting an ongoing reluctance among homeowners to exchange their low-rate mortgages for materially higher rates along with elevated home prices.\n\nMeanwhile, sales of new single-family homes have risen for four consecutive quarters, with growth accelerating to 2.9 percent in the second quarter from 0.2 percent in the previous quarter.  The upward trend in sales for the past year has weighed more heavily on the inventory to sales ratios for new homes.  From a post-pandemic peak of 10.1 months in July 2022, the ratio dropped to a 15-month low of 7.2 months of supply in May 2023 and, for the second quarter as a whole, stood at 7.5 months.\n\nHome Prices and Rents: Home price inflation accelerated markedly in the second quarter, rising back above pre-pandemic trends (see Table 5 – Home Price and Rent Indicators).  From June 2022 to December 2022, both primary measures of house prices declined on net, but they began increasing again early in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting the combination of low inventories and solid demand.  Both the S&P/Case-Shiller index and the FHFA purchase only-index rebounded noticeably in the second quarter to date (April and May).  As of May 2023, the S&P/Case-Shiller’s national home price index was within 1 percent of the June 2022 peak, while the FHFA’s measure reached a fresh record-high reading.\n\nShelter cost growth continued to ease slightly for non-owners according to official statistics—but from elevated levels—while measures of new rental agreements showed an upturn.  Growth in the CPI for rent of primary residence slowed to 6.2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter – still rapid, but roughly two-thirds the pace seen in each of the final two quarters of 2022.  However, the CPI for rent is a lagged measure, trailing prices from rental unit listing services by about four quarters.  These services showed that rental inflation more than doubled in the second quarter, after decelerating from summer 2021 through the first quarter of this year, as would-be buyers chose renting over rising mortgage rates and high home prices, amidst a dearth of available supply available for sale.\n\nRisks to the Banking System: The banking system is sound and well-capitalized, but financial instability remains an important risk to monitor.  Higher interest rates continue to pose heightened risks of asset/liability mismatch for banks.  Moreover, uneven banking system exposure to commercial real estate loans may put pressure on some smaller banks.  The U.S. government is committed to taking actions to maintain financial stability.\n\nInflation: Although inflation has fallen from the highs of mid-2022, it remains well above pre-pandemic rates and the Federal Reserve’s target.  The paths of energy and food prices remain highly uncertain and face further risk from weather and geopolitical developments in the months ahead. Adverse shocks—including related to Russia’s ongoing brutal war in Ukraine, on both energy and food prices—could result in temporary boosts of near-term headline inflation.  Secondary effects could filter into core components of inflation over time.  Excluding food and energy prices, core inflation is likely to stay above the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target throughout 2023, reflecting elevated inflation for housing rent as well as other core services.  Inflationary pressures from rent are expected to ease in the coming months based on slowing in rents for new lease agreements, although recent data suggest potential upside risk for rent inflation in the coming months.  Core services excluding rent of housing inflation is also likely to remain elevated through 2023 but is expected to continue easing in response to higher interest rates.\n\nInterest Rates and the Housing Market: Although higher mortgage rates have reduced affordability as well as transaction volumes, home prices remain substantially above the pre-pandemic trend.  Risks have shifted as the housing market has stabilized.  Largely due to low supply, house prices have started increasing.  Combined with higher mortgage rates, this means the market faces greater risks in terms of affordability and reduced dynamism.  It also implies a risk that higher rents could lead to more persistent rental inflation.\n\nGeopolitical Risks: Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to add uncertainty to the medium-term outlook.  In addition, uncertainty about China’s economic prospects has created concern about global demand in the coming months. At the same time, central banks around the world are continuing to tighten monetary policy to fight high global rates of inflation.  A potential slowdown in global economic activity may feed back into the U.S. economy by weakening international demand for U.S. goods and service exports.\n\nThe American economy remains strong, bolstered by President Biden’s economic plan and Secretary Yellen’s approach to modern supply-side economics.  Over the past two and a half years, the Biden-Harris Administration has made significant investments to lower costs and strengthen our economy.  These investments will boost economic potential and make our economy more resilient to risks.\n\nAverage Monthly Change\n\n(thousands)\n\nAnnual

    "Press Releases\nPresident Biden, Treasury Department Announce Approval of Federal Funds to Connect 16,000 North Carolina Homes and Businesses to High-Speed Internet\nJanuary 18, 2024\nFunds awarded through the American Rescue Plan’s Capital Projects Fund, part of President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda\n\nRALEIGH, NC – Today, President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. Department of the Treasury approved $82.2 million for high-speed internet projects in North Carolina under the American Rescue Plan’s Capital Projects Fund (CPF), which the state estimates will connect approximately 16,000 homes and businesses to affordable, high-speed internet. A key priority of the CPF program is making funding available for broadband infrastructure to expand economic opportunities and provide high-speed internet connectivity in underserved communities, including rural, Tribal, and other underserved communities.\n\n“With the partnership of your Governor we’ve invested over $3 Billion to expand high-speed internet in every county across the state,” President Biden said. “Fiber-optic cable is being laid in the ground as we speak. Over the next 3 years over 300,000 homes and businesses across North Carolina will be connected. And today I’m announcing another major step: another $82 Million to connect over 16,000 additional homes and businesses bringing high-speed internet across the state. By the end of the decade, we will finish the job, reaching all remaining homes, schools, libraries small businesses and healthcare facilities in North Carolina that don’t have access to high-speed internet today.”\n\n“The pandemic upended life as we knew it and exposed the stark inequity in access to affordable and reliable high-speed internet in communities across the country,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “This funding is a key piece of the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic investments to increase access to high-speed internet for millions of Americans and provide more opportunities to fully participate and compete in the 21st century economy.”\n\nThe CPF provides a total of $10 billion to states, territories, freely associated states, and Tribal governments to fund critical capital projects that expand economic opportunities and provide internet connectivity in communities with unmet needs. Through high-speed internet, digital technology, and multi-purpose community facility investments, CPF funding is both closing the digital divide and bringing workforce, education, and health care services to communities in need. In addition to the $10 billion provided by CPF, many governments are putting a portion of their State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) toward meeting the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of connecting every American household to affordable, reliable high-speed internet.\n\nThe $82.2 million announced today will fund the Broadband Stop Gap Solutions Program to extend high-speed internet service to reach individual or small pockets of households or businesses which have not been reached through prior federal investments. North Carolina’s Broadband Infrastructure Office will work with counties to identify remaining locations that lack high-speed internet and then make Stop Gap Program awards on a county-by-county basis. Today’s announcement is in addition to the $177.7 million in CPF funding the Treasury Department awarded North Carolina in 2022, which was used to fund broadband infrastructure projects.\n\nOverall, the Biden-Harris Administration is investing $3 billion in North Carolina to connect everyone in the state to affordable, reliable high-speed internet through the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These investments are creating thousands of good-paying manufacturing and construction jobs in places like North Carolina to produce Made-in-America fiber-optic cable that will build out internet infrastructure across the country. And, because of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Affordable Connectivity Program, over 880,000 households in North Carolina are saving money on their internet bills every month.\n\nThe Treasury Department began announcing state awards in June 2022. To date, CPF has awarded over $9 billion for broadband, digital technology, and multi-purpose community center projects in all states and the District of Columbia, which states estimate will reach over two million locations with expanded internet access, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of individuals who will be served annually by multi-purpose community facilities.\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nU.S. Department of the Treasury Announces New Funding to Support Technical Assistance for Small Businesses as Part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America Agenda\nJuly 2, 2024\nWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the approval of plans for an additional $10 million in technical assistance (TA) funding allocated to four states, two territories, the District of Columbia, and one Tribal government under the American Rescue Plan Act’s State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) TA Grant Program. Included in these approvals is the first SSBCI TA grant for a Tribal government.\n\nPart of President Biden’s economic agenda, the SSBCI TA Grant Program supports programs that provide legal, accounting, and financial advisory services to qualifying small businesses. Treasury allocated $200 million by formula to states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments for the TA Grant Program and, as of today, has announced awards totaling over $145 million.\n\n“Today’s announcement reinforces President Biden’s commitment to invest in small businesses and entrepreneurs,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “Providing help to entrepreneurs like accounting services and legal advice is critical to unlocking their potential for growth and to continuing the nation’s historic small business boom.”\n\nReauthorized and expanded by the American Rescue Plan Act, SSBCI is a nearly $10 billion program to support small businesses and entrepreneurship in communities across the United States to promote small business stability, growth, and success- in states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments. In addition to the TA Grant Program, Treasury also administers the SSBCI Capital Program, where participating jurisdictions implement credit and equity/venture capital programs to provide capital to small businesses.\n\nThe first Tribal government to receive a TA grant is Levelock Village. Approved for $65,327 in TA grant funding, Levelock Village will use contractors to provide legal and financial advisory services to underserved and very small businesses participating in the Tribe’s SSBCI-supported direct investment program (previously approved for up to $627,054) or seeking other small business support. TA programs like that of Levelock Village – a remote Alaska community accessible only by air or water travel with an economy that relies on local fishing and hunting – will support access to capital and small business support services in Indian Country, which are often banking and TA deserts.\n\nThe $10 million TA investment also included four states, two territories, and the District of Columbia. This includes Minnesota, which was approved for $1,972,321 in TA grant funding, and will use the Minnesota Small Business Development Center (SBDC) statewide network within the Minnesota Department of Employment & Economic Development to implement its TA program. The SBDC lead center will coordinate with its nine regional SBDC offices around the state, as well as other business service organizations, to identify eligible beneficiaries. Under the management of the SBDC, TA contractors will provide eligible legal and accounting services.\n\nWith today’s announcement, Treasury has announced the approvals of SSBCI TA grants totaling over $145 million and representing 48 states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments. Treasury anticipates additional approvals of applications from Tribal governments to follow. See the full list of approved programs here.\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nU.S. Department of the Treasury Highlights $4.8 Million Award to Help Mississippi Small Businesses Grow and Hire\nOctober 10, 2024\nWASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) highlighted the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA)’s $4.8 million award to support small business growth. This award is one of 14 recently announced through the Biden-Harris Administration’s State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) Investing in America Small Business Opportunity Program (SBOP). Mississippi’s initiative will be supported by $2.2 million in matching funds from Innovate Mississippi.\n\nAs part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s economic agenda, this $75 million program provides funding to connect underserved and very small businesses to the capital needed to participate in key Investing in America supply chains, including electric vehicle manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing, construction, transportation, clean energy generation, and more. The SBOP was designed to catalyze additional private sector investment by supporting small business technical assistance services like accounting and legal services.\n\n“The Biden-Harris Administration’s economic agenda is focused on continuing the historic small business boom by helping entrepreneurs across the country succeed,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “With this new funding, Mississippi will increase access to capital and customers for both high growth startups and Main Street small businesses, and will allow businesses to seize new opportunities created by investments in advanced manufacturing.”\n\n“Today’s announcement to fund critical small business technical assistance programs will help ensure that more small businesses can thrive, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration plan that is powering a small business boom with a record 19 million new business applications so far,” said National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard.\n\n\"This award is an opportunity to increase small business participation in Mississippi. It's very much needed, and I look forward to full-throated engagement with the small business community”, said U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson.\n\n“Small business is the backbone of the Mississippi economy, and these federal funds will further enhance Mississippi’s already strong support of this part of our economy,” said Mississippi Development Authority Executive Director Bill Cork.\n\nMDA was selected for the SBOP award through a competitive process. MDA will work alongside the Mississippi Small Business Development Center Network (MSBDCN) and Innovate Mississippi (Innovate MS) to assist Mississippi companies in preparing for growth funding. Using this $4.8 million, as well as $2.2 million in matching funds from Innovate Mississippi, MDA will launch ConnectMS, a project aimed to address gaps in the state's entrepreneurial ecosystem, focusing on helping very small businesses (VSBs) and underserved businesses prepare to raise capital.\n\nThe ConnectMS project will span all of Mississippi’s 82 counties, utilizing state-wide regional clusters to scale business programming and increase access to capital for startups and VSBs. The project will include a five-step approach, which includes the FoundersPlus and CoBuilders Accelerator. FoundersPlus will offer entrepreneurial education and a weekly webinar series, and the CoBuilders Accelerator will provide a multi-week virtual program that will support access to venture capital for startups. The program will also establish a Virtual Small Business Incubator, helping traditional businesses access funding through workshops, one-on-one counseling, pitch events, and tailored technical assistance.\n\nSelected SBOP jurisdictions will build or expand technical assistance programs focused on connecting very small and underserved businesses to financing available through SSBCI, or other state or federal small business programs, including in the infrastructure, manufacturing, clean energy, or climate resiliency space. Jurisdictions have been selected based on their plans to create innovative, high-impact models of small business technical assistance delivery that demonstrate a vision to improve access to capital for historically overlooked businesses across the nation.\n\nA fact sheet summarizing all 14 SBOP awards can be found here.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act reauthorized and expanded SSBCI, which provides nearly $10 billion to support small businesses and empower them to access the capital needed to invest in job-creating opportunities. SSBCI provides funds to states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments to promote American entrepreneurship, support small business ownership, and democratize access to capital across the country, including in underserved communities. Through the SSBCI Capital Program, Treasury has approved plans for small business financing programs totaling over $8.7 billion and representing every state and territory, the District of Columbia, and 280 Tribal governments.\n\nIn addition to today’s announcement, Treasury has announced the approvals of SSBCI Technical Assistance grants allocated by formula to states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments, representing $145 million for 48 jurisdictions. Treasury anticipates additional approvals of applications to follow. See the full list of approved formula SSBCI Technical Assistance programs here.\n\n###",
    "Statements & Remarks\nRemarks by Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy (P.D.O.) Eric Van Nostrand on U.S. Business Investment in the Post-COVID Expansion\nNovember 13, 2024\nAs Prepared for Delivery\n\nI am honored to join you at PIIE, an institution that has done as much as any to help policymakers and the public think through the trade-offs that animate the thorniest questions of economic policy. I am grateful to Adam Posen for extending his welcome; to Caroline Atkinson, our distinguished moderator; and to all of you for joining us.\n\nI am privileged to lead Treasury’s Office of Economic Policy in the Biden Administration. Our team works to inform the Administration’s policymaking process with rigorous economic analysis and to understand the economic impact of our existing policies. Today I am excited to think through with all of you a topic of central importance to the U.S. economy and to our Administration’s goals: the state of and outlook for American business investment.\n\nThe Biden Administration has promoted policies encouraging business investment because it is necessary to improve outcomes for American families in the long run. For a prosperous corporate sector to truly benefit families and workers, businesses must feel confident investing their profits to generate new jobs, opportunities, and innovations. And by recognizing the public sector’s role in creating incentives to solve market failures in strategically important industries like clean technology and semiconductors, we can expand our economy’s ability to produce in the long run: a strategy that Secretary Yellen has called “modern supply-side economics.”\n\nBusiness investment has been surprisingly strong in the post-pandemic economy. Higher interest rates raise firms’ borrowing costs and are typically expected to slow investment growth. Higher uncertainty around macroeconomic forecasts in the post-pandemic expansion should also have slowed investment. But instead, business investment has grown faster in the United States than before the pandemic. I will begin by considering the post-pandemic performance of U.S. private nonresidential fixed investment (business fixed investment, or “BFI”) against three counterfactuals: historical experience, forecasters’ expectations, and international comparators. I will show that U.S. BFI has outperformed all three counterfactuals since the pandemic.\n\nThe well-documented surge in construction of high-tech manufacturing facilities related to public incentives in the CHIPS and Inflation Reduction Act explains much of the outperformance. There’s more to it than just those public incentives: I will explore evidence that global investors perceive abnormal returns to U.S. investment even outside those strategic sectors, including the rise in entrepreneurship and the rise in foreign direct investment into the United States. But the contributions of CHIPS and the IRA to the investment boom are palpable.\n\nFinally, I will consider the outlook for business investment. The tailwind from manufacturing construction cannot continue in perpetuity and may become a drag on BFI growth in the coming years as groundbreakings recede. But if incentives to invest in the clean energy and semiconductor space persists, investors’ focus is likely to shift from building those factories to bringing them online and staffing them, creating upside for equipment and intellectual property investment. Any steps by the next Administration to weaken these important incentives risks slowing investment growth, and thereby undermining the important progress that American businesses have made expanding our productive capacity.\n\nFirst, let me consider a historical counterfactual. Figure 1 shows BFI as a share of GDP since the COVID business cycle peak (blue), compared with the analogous period in the Great Recession and Recovery (orange), and the average behavior in all U.S. business cycles since 1971 (dotted). Typically, investment tends to fall as a percent of GDP in a recession and to continue to contribute less well into the recovery.  This was especially the case in the 2008 Great Recession, when business investment as percent of GDP fell by more than 2 percentage points.  In recent years, business investment has bucked that trend, remaining at roughly the same share of GDP since before COVID: a better outcome than after every other recession since 1980. Indeed, in this cycle, American businesses invested $625 billion more than if overall growth had been the same but investment followed its usual historical pattern.[1]\n\nFigure 1\n\nNotes: Business cycle peaks are the National Bureau of Economic Research’s quarterly business cycle peaks. “Business fixed investment” is private nonresidential fixed investment. Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis; National Bureau of Economic Research; U.S. Treasury calculations.\n\nA second benchmark: what did economic forecasters expect for business investment growth earlier in the cycle? U.S. business investment has generally outpaced economists’ “conventional wisdom,” as measured both by consensus forecasts and using conventional modeling tools.\n\nFigure 2 shows actual calendar-year growth in business investment (blue bars) for 2022-2024, alongside the Blue Chip consensus forecasts for October 2019 (red bars) and October 2022 (green bars). Realized investment has outpaced the pre-COVID and post-COVID forecasts. The pre-COVID forecasts from 2019 reflected the expectation that a historically middling rate of business investment growth between 3 and 4 percent would persist in the years ahead. Of course, those forecasts were missed significantly in 2020 as investment collapsed during the pandemic, and were beaten significantly in 2021 amid the reopening. But even once aggregate growth normalized in 2022, investment has continued to rise at a pace significantly above the pre-COVID forecasts, The post-COVID forecasts from October 2022 reflected an environment where the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes were well underway and markets expected persistently higher rates. Actual business investment growth outperformed each of these forecasts from 2022 to 2024 to date.\n\nFigure 2\n\nNotes: Actual investment growth reflects the actual annual average growth rate in private nonresidential fixed investment. Blue Chip Forecasts are the consensus forecasts for the same reported by Blue Chip Economic Indicators in October 2019 and October 2022. *For 2024, an estimate of actual growth is shown assuming that reported growth rate in the first three quarters of 2024 persists in the fourth quarter. Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis; Blue Chip Economic Indicators; U.S. Treasury calculations.\n\nIt is useful to consider what sort of mechanical logic drove those prevailing forecasts (pre-COVID and post-COVID) for historically middling business investment growth. In the classical accelerator model, changes in the capital stock are driven by changes in output. Firms invest based on their desired level of capital, itself proportional to output, to maximize their expected future profits, not simply because they currently have high profits or substantial retained earnings. Capital then increases when output growth increases; that is, businesses invest more when the economy grows faster.\n\nFigure 3 implements the Jorgensen-Siebert (1968) accelerator model, in which investment depends on recent lags to overall output growth. In the immediate pandemic recovery, these models predicted a quick rebound in investment, which was indeed matched by reality. But once the economy cooled from that initial burst of growth, the models called for slower investment growth as shown on the right side of Figure 3. From the second half of 2022 through 2024, investment grew significantly faster than a conventional accelerator model would imply. Firms were investing more quickly than conventional models implied.\n\nFigure 3\n\nComparing the U.S. experience to other advanced economies provides a third counterfactual. Global challenges including the upturn in inflation and the ensuing increase in global interest rates impacted other advanced economies (albeit to varying degrees), but something has been markedly different with respect to American investment.\n\nIt has been widely recognized that aggregate U.S. growth has run faster than that of other G7 economies.[2] And investment is an important contributor to that outperformance. Figure 4 compares the change in real investment from pre-pandemic levels—the 2019 average—to the most recent four quarters ending 2024:Q2 across the G7. Comparing similar concepts of business investment across countries can be challenging, but Figure 4 seeks to identify the closest proxy possible in each country to the U.S. concept of business investment: real capital formation by private actors excluding residential investment.\n\nBy these measures, U.S. outperformance is quite striking: business investment has risen almost 17 percent since 2019, nearly double the closest other G7 country (Italy). Indeed, a few G7 countries are still seeing real investment levels below that which prevailed over the pandemic. To be sure, other G7 countries have faced different challenges than the United States, not least Europe’s proximity to shocks from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But U.S. outperformance is striking nonetheless.\n\nFigure 4\n\nNotes: Data for other countries seek to mirror the U.S. BFI concept as closely as possible given each country’s national accounts structure.

All data seasonally adjusted, either by the source or with X-13-ARIMA.\n\nI will turn now to candidate explanations for the performance of business investment in the United States.  First, decomposing investment from an accounting perspective can help shed some light. The national accounts divide business investment into structures investment (construction), equipment investment (physical capital expenditures outside construction), and intellectual property investment (including research and development, software, and other non-physical capital formation). Figure 6 decomposes investment growth along these lines, further dividing structures investment into construction for manufacturing and non-manufacturing.\n\nOver the 35 years leading up to the Great Recession (left bar) and the 12 years following the Global Financial Crisis (middle), the average composition of business investment growth was largely consistent: significant contributions from investment in equipment and in intellectual property, with some small varying contribution from changes in structures investment (construction) in non-manufacturing sectors. Investment in manufacturing structures (factory construction) made no contribution on average.\n\nBut since 2021, the picture has looked different; average contributions from equipment and intellectual property have been largely consistent, but a new contributor has appeared: construction for manufacturing structures (essentially, factory building). Factory construction has added more than 1 percentage point at an annual rate to BFI growth on its own, explaining most of the elevated rate of BFI growth relative to history.\n\nFigure 6\n\nNotes: Growth in private nonresidential fixed investment is decomposed into contributions from equipment, intellectual property, manufacturing structures, and other structures over the indicated time periods. Contributions are inferred from the given subcomponents’ published contributions to private fixed investment growth, and then scaled by the ratio of private nonresidential fixed investment growth (BFI growth) to BFI growth’s contribution to overall private fixed investment growth. Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis; U.S. Treasury calculations.\n\nThe surge in factory construction is well documented: spending has more than doubled in real terms since 2021 and it has further increased since then.[3] Of course, one should not expect this surge to continue in perpetuity, so its contributions to business investment growth should dwindle. But it has reflected a new kind of private investment that helps explain the resilience of overall business investment.  Data from the Census Bureau allows us to further decompose the surge in manufacturing construction. Figure 7 compares the composition of real manufacturing construction spending on average from 2005-2022 to the average since the beginning of 2023. Factories in “computer, electrical, and electronic” manufacturing are the obvious source of the surge—a category that includes semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries. This is consistent with the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act achieving their aim of encouraging private investment in semiconductor and clean technology manufacturing.\n\nFigure 7\n\nNotes: Value of private construction put in place for manufacturing decomposed by detailed type. Monthly at a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate. Nominal spending is deflated by the producer price index for intermediate demand materials and components for construction. Source: U.S. Census Bureau; Bureau of Labor Statistics; U.S. Treasury calculations.\n\nHere, international context is again helpful to identify the drivers of the shift. No harmonized data series provides an exact comparison to the United States, but comparable data indicators help unveil the relevant trends. Importantly, the boom appears to be uniquely American.\n\nOther advanced economies have not experienced similar increases, according to roughly analogous data sets measuring some concept of real construction for manufacturing purposes (Figure 7). Japan has had seen increases in the floor area of new manufacturing over the past year, but construction remains below pre-pandemic levels. Germany’s real new construction spending on factory and workshop buildings has remained relatively stable over the past decade. Notably, the United Kingdom and Australia did see some meaningful increases in real industrial construction in 2022 and 2023. But those series have leveled off or fallen since then, over the period in which U.S. manufacturing construction has nearly doubled.\n\nFigure 8\n\nNotes: U.S. Value of Private Construction Put in Place for Manufacturing, U.S. Census Bureau.

But as shown back in Figure 4, even if the contribution from factory-building disappeared, other components of BFI are still growing at higher levels than history, despite the headwind of higher interest rates.\n\nSo factory-building alone cannot be the whole story. American businesses are still investing as if they expect abnormally high returns to investing in the United States, even outside those sectors explicitly encouraged by the Biden Administration policies.\n\nIndeed, estimates of the return to all private capital—while difficult to observe directly—suggest that realized returns to investment remain historically high. Observing these high returns gives businesses confidence that their investments will pay off in the future. Perhaps best understood as the “aggregate return on all private investment,” the return to all private capital reflects the total returns generated by the full capital stock of the United States. Estimates vary, but Figure 9 uses the methodology developed in Furman (2015). This measure of the return to private capital has hovered around 7 percent since 2015, a figure that remains well above today’s elevated borrowing costs. This calculation is only available through 2023, but strong corporate profit growth and high recent returns in public equity markets, even relative to higher interest rates, suggest that businesses are observing no slowdown in returns available in the market.\n\nFigure 9\n\nNotes: The return to all private capital is measured as in Furman (2015), as the private capital income as a percent of the prior year’s private capital stock. Private capital income is defined as the sum of 1) corporate profits excluding federal government tax receipts on corporate income, 2) net interest and miscellaneous payments, 3) rental income of all persons, 4) business current transfer payments, 5) current surpluses of government enterprises, 6) property and severance taxes, and 7) the capital share of proprietors’ income, where the capital share was assumed to match the capital share of aggregate income. The private capital stock is defined as the sum of 1) the net stock of produced private assets for all private enterprises, 2) the value of total private land inferred from the Financial Accounts of the U.S., and 3) the value of U.S. capital deployed abroad less foreign capital deployed in the U.S. Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis; Federal Reserve Board; U.S. Treasury calculations.\n\nThere are two pieces of evidence suggesting that business leaders expect these high returns to continue. The first is that more Americans are starting firms. The higher rate of start-ups suggests that more founders expect strong returns from starting businesses than otherwise. There has been a well-recognized[4] surge in applications to start new businesses since the pandemic, with over 19 million new applications since the end of 2020. While the pace of new business applications has eased somewhat from its heights last year, as shown in Figure 10, that pace remains well above the steady pre-COVID rate. While business formation data for the pandemic period are not fully available, application rates are predictive of actual business formations. Actual business formations from the subsequent eight quarters have a correlation coefficient of +0.9 with applications from likely employers.[5]\n\nFigure 10\n\nNotes: Applications with planned wages are those that include an explicit date when wages will first be paid. High-propensity business applications are those that the Census Bureau considers likely to pay wages, including those with planned wages as well as other indicators. Source: U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe surge in business applications following the pandemic is so sharp that one might wonder whether it truly reflects a rise in entrepreneurship, or whether it may be some measurement artifact related to a pandemic-era distortion. However, several pieces of evidence suggest that the surge is real and no well-supported alternative explanation has been offered a few years into this trend.\n\nFirst, as shown in Figure 10, the surge is not confined to the broadest set of business applications, which includes many sole proprietorships or other entities that may not fit prevailing understandings of a “small business” (left panel). A similar surge is present for those applications the Census considers having a high propensity to pay wages (middle panel), as well as those who indicate a date on which they will begin paying wages (right panel). Second, the surge follows the patterns of broader post-COVID economic changes. Haltiwanger (2022)[6] showed that the surge was concentrated in industries likely well suited to a work-from-home environment, such as non-store retailers and professional, scientific, and technical services. Decker and Haltiwanger (2023)[7] examined the geographic distribution of applications and showed they were concentrated in “donuts” around urban centers, consistent with post-pandemic residential and workplace shifts. CEA (2024)[8] examines a broader set of administrative data that helps establish the veracity of the surge.\n\nWhile much more work will be done to understand the surge, the evidence suggests that there is a real impulse here. This is not simply a rebound from the pandemic. There are many candidate explanations: the prevalence of remote work or the gig economy making the decision to start a business less costly or risky, the rise in household wealth experienced since the pandemic enabling more people to risk opening businesses, or even a broader shift in cultural attitudes toward risk-taking. In any case, we observe that more Americans are starting small businesses at a faster rate just as those businesses are playing a growing role in our economy. It is worth noting that those businesses need capital— phones, computers, software, printers, and cars — whether they are launched in the garage, the basement, or an incubator.\n\nA second piece of evidence that business leaders are perceiving higher than normal returns is the picture from inbound foreign direct investment. During the prior expansion, FDI into the United States generally comprised between 10 and 25 percent of global FDI, as shown in Figure 11. But it has spent much of the post-pandemic recovery above that range. More recently, it has settled back into the high end of its old range, but United States is clearly attracting a larger share of global FDI in this cycle than the last. This trend likely has many drivers, but it is consistent with business leaders perceiving especially high returns to investment in the United States.\n\nFigure 11\n\nNotes: Inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) is the value of investment from foreign investors flowing into resident U.S. firms as a proportion of all such flows globally. Inbound flows are net of transactions that decrease the total investment of foreign firms in U.S. enterprises. Source: OECD; U.S. Treasury Calculations.\n\nI will turn now to the distributional implications of strong U.S. business investment, with a particular focus on two elements that we have already discussed: the investment surge in clean energy technologies associated with the Inflation Reduction Act and the increase in U.S. entrepreneurship.\n\nWe analyze the geographic and socioeconomic distribution of clean energy investment announcements using data from the Clean Investment Monitor (CIM). The CIM is a joint product of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Rhodium Group that catalogs and maps U.S. clean energy investments before and after the IRA passed. Since the IRA passed, clean investments have been landing in more economically disadvantaged counties: those with below average wages, incomes, employment rates, and college graduation rates.\n\nMore than 75 percent of post-IRA clean investments have gone to counties with below-average median incomes, as shown in Figure 12; more than 85 percent have gone to counties with below-average college graduation rates. This is true across all regions of the country and all technologies supported by the IRA; the investment and benefits tend to accrue to disadvantaged counties. We detailed these findings further in Treasury (2024).[9]\n\nFigure 12\n\nNotes: Median household income is the 2022 value. College graduation rate, defined as a Bachelor’s degree or higher, is the 2022 value from the American Community Survey. Source: Clean Investment Monitor; U.S. Census Bureau; U.S. Treasury calculations.\n\nOne underappreciated aspect of the entrepreneurship surge is that the population of Americans working for themselves is growing more diverse. Self-employed workers reflect an important subset of small business owners: those who work for profit in their own unincorporated business.[10] The share of self-employed Americans who are Black is also near its all-time high after surging throughout the expansion (Figure 12). This observation is consistent with data from the Survey of Consumer Finances showing that Black business ownership grew faster between 2019 and 2022 than over the previous thirty years.[11]\n\nFigure 13\n\nNotes: Non-agricultural industries. Data are smoothed with a three-month moving average. Data are not seasonally adjusted, though seasonal adjustment with X-13-ARIMA has a negligible impact on the series. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics; U.S. Treasury calculations.\n\nU.S. business investment is outperforming history, expectations, and that of our peer countries. But the outlook for the coming years remains uncertain. We have little historical precedent for the next phase of clean energy and semiconductor investment. We cannot expect the same abnormal growth in manufacturing construction that has been so important to investment in the recent past, but we should expect new forms of investment as those factories come online. We try to stay out of the forecasting business in the Administration, but Goldman Sachs argued this week[12] that equipment investment will boost growth in BFI by 2 percentage points next year, as IRA and CHIPS-factories are built out. Goldman believes this effect will offset most of the drag from slower factory construction.\n\nAn important risk to that outlook, though, is the potential that the incentives for continued investment in the clean technology and semiconductor space are reduced under the next Administration. These incentives are an important mechanism for encouraging more private investment, as we have seen in recent years. And any steps to weaken them threaten to undermine that progress.\n\nFinancial markets largely expect interest rates to continue to fall over the course of the year, unwinding one of the principal headwinds for business investment this cycle. The policy landscape will surely impact the outlook as well. Lower tax rates on corporations can increase near-term investment, but trade-offs between such near-term fiscal expansion and long-term fiscal sustainability may be tested more than ever before. The prospect of broadly applied tariffs also stands to weigh on investment. Goldman Sachs found that the increased tariffs of 2019 weighed on investment by increasing firms’ input costs, baiting retaliatory tariffs against U.S. goods, and adding to broader policy uncertainty. Taken together, Goldman found that the 2019 tariff increases were associated with a 1-1.6 percent fall in total investment.[13]\n\nDespite the near-term uncertainty, U.S. businesses have been persistently investing at historically robust rates since the pandemic, with more Americans starting businesses and more global investors looking to the United States to invest. The high level of investment has grown and will continue to grow the capital stock, even if further growth in investment itself subsides, driving faster growth of the capital stock and therefore our potential output. There is much reason to be optimistic that the business sector’s success growing our productive capacity will persist in the years ahead.\n\n###\n\n[1] Actual business fixed investment from 2020:Q1 to 2024:Q3 was $16,287 billion, when summed over periods. As a counterfactual, we measure what business fixed investment would have been if actual nominal GDP figures were realized over that period, but business fixed investment as a share of GDP followed the average pattern depicted in the dotted line in Figure 1; this is $15,661 billion, for a difference of $626 billion.\n\n[2] See, for example, Ben Harris & Robin Brooks, The U.S. Recovery from COVID-19 in International Comparison (Brookings 2024).\n\n[3] Van Nostrand, Eric, Tara Sinclair, and Samarth Gupta. \"Unpacking the Boom in U.S. Construction of Manufacturing Facilities.\" U.S. Department of the Treasury.

    "Press Releases\nU.S. Department of the Treasury Report: Homeowners Insurance Costs Rising, Availability Declining as Climate-Related Events Take Their Toll\nJanuary 16, 2025\nAs the latest climate-related crisis unfolds in Los Angeles, Treasury releases most comprehensive data on homeowners insurance in history, along with report detailing higher costs to homeowners and insurers of elevated climate perils.\n\nWASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office (FIO) today released the most comprehensive data on homeowners insurance in history, along with a major report showing that homeowners insurance is becoming more costly and harder to procure for millions of Americans as the costs of climate-related events pose growing challenges to insurers and their customers alike.\n\nThe report is based on the most comprehensive and granular snapshot of the homeowners insurance market to date, covering over 330 insurers on more than 246 million homeowners insurance policies aggregated to the ZIP Code level from 2018 to 2022 (an annual average of 49.3 million policies). The data was collected through a first-of-its-kind effort by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, state insurance regulators, and FIO.\n\nAmong the report’s key findings:\n\nClimate change is making it more costly for insurers to operate. Insurers’ costs in 2018-2022 were higher in areas with the highest expected losses from climate-related perils. The paid loss ratio, which reflects how much insurers paid for claims relative to what they received in premiums, was highest in the highest risk ZIP Codes. These areas had a higher frequency of claims and severity of claims, about $24,000 on average compared to an average of about $19,000 for lowest risk areas.\n\nHomeowners insurance is important to U.S. consumers, the economy, and the financial system. For many Americans, their home is their largest financial asset and the cost and availability of adequate homeowners insurance has a direct impact on housing expenses and the value of homes. The cost and availability of insurance can also have significant consequences for local governments whose tax bases rely on property values. Moreover, homes are increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that, from 2018-2022, 84 billion dollar disasters (excluding floods) cost over $609 billion and costs for such disasters have continued to rise since then. Today’s report considers homeowners insurance costs in the context of nine types of climate-related perils, explicitly excluding flooding (which is not typically covered by homeowners insurance policies) and non-climate-related disasters like earthquakes.\n\n“Treasury’s analysis comes at a time of devastating tragedy, loss of life, and destruction from the wildfires in the Los Angeles area,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “While it’s far from clear what the exact financial costs of this disaster will be, it is a stark reminder of the impacts of the growing magnitude of natural disasters on the U.S. economy. Moreover, this disaster does not stand alone as evidence of this impact, with other climate-related events leading to challenges for Americans in finding affordable insurance coverage – from severe storms in the Great Plains to hurricanes in the Southeast. This report identifies alarming trends of rising costs of insurance – to consumers and insurers themselves – as well as lack of availability of insurance, all of which threaten the long-term prosperity of American families.”\n\n“Data and analysis, like those in this report, are critical for helping policymakers understand how substantial climate-related property losses are being spread across homeowners, insurers, and governments,” said Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang. “Our analysis is based on an important collaborative effort by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, state insurance regulators, and FIO to collect nationwide, granular data to better understand and address current homeowners insurance challenges. Given the increasing frequency and severity of climate events, it is essential to build on and continue this effort.”\n\nIn May 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14030 directing FIO to “assess, in consultation with States, the potential for major disruptions of private insurance coverage in regions of the country particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts.”\n\nInsurance in the United States is regulated at the state level. In March 2024, FIO announced it was engaging in a first-of-its-kind partnership with the NAIC, on the behalf of state insurance regulators, to collect data on the homeowners insurance market. The NAIC shared a subset of the collected data with FIO, with regular meetings between NAIC and FIO to collaborate, review and assess the data up to and beyond an agreed upon deadline of September 27, 2024. This report and the data collection effort complements the important efforts that states and local communities are undertaking to understand and address market challenges from the higher costs of climate-related disasters and other factors weighing on homeowners insurance markets.\n\nTo promote greater public transparency, while protecting the privacy of insurers and consumers, Treasury is releasing a large subset of the aggregated ZIP Code level data underlying the analysis in this report. In particular, data presented in the report are being made available for ZIP Codes where there are at least ten insurers and at least 50 policies. These data can be downloaded here.  More detail on the data collection and limitations for the data used in the report and the data being made available to the public are discussed in the report.\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nReport to the Secretary of the Treasury from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee\nFebruary 5, 2025\nFebruary 4, 2025\n\nLetter to the Secretary\n\nDear Mr. Secretary,\n\nCongratulations on your appointment; we look forward to working with you. Since the TBAC last met in late October, 2-year Treasury yields are little changed while 10-year Treasury yields increased by about 25bp. The broad trade-weighted dollar appreciated 2.1% and is close to its high since 2022. Equity prices continued to advance with the S&P 500 up 4.0%.  Interest rates and other asset prices have responded to the backdrop of robust growth and cooling, if still elevated, inflation, as well as to expected policies from the new Administration.\n\nThe rise in longer-term interest rates and dollar appreciation in part reflect continued strong growth in the US, which is exceptional relative to softer growth elsewhere. Economic activity has continued to advance at a solid pace with real GDP up 2.8% on average in 2024, supported by consumer spending. Business and housing investment, which are more sensitive to higher interest rates, also contributed to growth in 2024, but not as robustly.\n\nMarket concerns regarding downside risk to employment have diminished from their peak last September. After rising from a low of 3.4%, the unemployment rate stabilized at 4.1%-4.2% in the second half of 2024, and payroll job growth averaged 165k per month over the same period. The layoff rate is historically low at 1.1%, and initial claims for unemployment insurance are subdued. But the 3.3% hiring rate and 1.9% quit rate are below pre-pandemic norms, reflecting some softening of labor demand.\n\nVarious measures suggest inflation has significantly cooled but remains above the 2% target. Year-on-year core PCE inflation stood at 2.8% in December, but the three-month and six-month annualized paces have slowed to 2.2% and 2.3% respectively, suggesting year-on-year readings will fall in 2025. Market participants and Federal Reserve officials have been careful not to read too much into slower inflation in late 2024 as over the last two years inflation has accelerated in the first quarter.\n\nAfter reducing policy rates by one percentage point in the second half of 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) signaled a slower pace of rate cuts. The median “dot” in the December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) implies 50bp of cumulative rate cuts this year; since the December FOMC meeting, interest rate markets have priced-in between one and two 25bp rate cuts for 2025. Investors and Federal Reserve officials continue to debate whether and to what extent the long-term “neutral” policy rate has moved higher. Longer-term Treasury yields have remained elevated in part due to expectations that the US economy can continue to grow at rates at-or-above 2% with interest rates at higher levels than prevailed over the last 15 years.\n\nExpectations regarding government policies are a key focus for the Treasury market and other markets. The Administration has indicated that it will pursue a fiscal package that will lower both taxes and spending and raise some new revenue through tariffs. The implied path of future deficits will affect Treasury issuance plans and therefore market interest rates. Markets will also remain sensitive to news on trade policy, with currency markets responding to which countries may be included in either targeted or across-the-board tariffs. Immigration policy and deregulation also affect the outlook for growth and inflation.\n\nIn light of this fiscal backdrop, the Committee reviewed Treasury’s February 2025 Quarterly Refunding Presentation. Based on the financing estimates published on February 3, Treasury currently expects privately-held net marketable borrowing of $815bln in Q2 FY 2025 (Q1 CY 2025), with an assumed end-of-March cash balance of $850bln. The borrowing estimate is $9bln lower than what was cited at the October 2024 refunding. For Q3 FY 2025 (Q2 CY 2025), privately-held net marketable borrowing is expected to be $123bln, with a cash balance of $850bln assumed at the end of June. These estimates assume enactment of a debt limit suspension or increase.\n\nSince October, primary dealers revised their deficit estimates slightly higher over each of FY 2025, 2026, and 2027, in an aggregate amount of $188b. Committee members noted the varied interest rate assumptions used by primary dealers, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Some Committee members noted that some of these projections assume current law, which could contribute to elevated uncertainty around these forecasts.\n\nDealers now see the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet reduction ending in the summer, rather than the spring, slightly increasing the expected need for borrowing from the private sector in 2025. It was noted that market participants viewed risks as skewed towards a later finish (even as far out as Q1 CY 2026), or to a multi-step wind down of QT, as reserves are seen as ample. However, change in bank regulation and liquidity management relative to September 2019, compounded by potential debt limit dynamics into the early summer, may complicate the forward assessment of ample reserves, which could drive an earlier end date, all else equal.\n\nThe Committee then moved to discuss the first of two charges, an assessment of Treasury’s buyback program. The Committee found, and dealer feedback confirms, that the program is broadly meeting its stated objectives of liquidity support and cash management, and that there is no pressing need for change. While the program is small within the context of the overall size of the Treasury market, the take up in many individual operations can be significant. Notably, buybacks for nominal maturities less than 2 years and more than 10 years were more consistently filled than for those in the belly of the curve. While the program is still relatively nascent, this could represent either less need for liquidity in the belly of the curve, less willingness to sell, or both. Relative value analysis suggests that buyback operations effectively balance between relative value considerations and liquidity provisioning. Ultimately, the Committee noted the following areas for further study (both in the deck and in discussion):\n\nThe second charge related to the SEC central clearing rule adopted in December 2023 titled “Standards for Covered Clearing Agencies for U.S. Treasury Securities and Application of the Broker-Dealer Customer Protection Rule with Respect to U.S. Treasury Securities” (the Rule). The Rule represents the most significant change in Treasury market structure in decades, with as much as $4 trillion in additional daily transactions to be centrally cleared.\n\nThe Committee noted a variety of scoping and implementation issues that needed to be clarified or solved in order for market participants to move forward with implementation:\n\nWhile CME and ICE have indicated that they intend to file (or have filed) applications to offer Treasury clearing, there is currently a single central counterparty (CCP) in the Treasury market. Multiple clearing houses could be a positive development for competition, innovation, and access but also could raise issues regarding complexity, interoperability, and fragmentation. The potential for cross-margining across products and CCPs will be a significant factor in CCP adoption.\n\nSIFMA and other industry associations have requested the implementations dates under the Rule be pushed back by a minimum of 12 months. The Committee noted that many market participants view an extension of the implementation dates as very likely.\n\nIn terms of issuance for the upcoming quarter, the Committee recommended that Treasury keep nominal coupon auction sizes unchanged. Turning to TIPS, the Committee supported increasing the 5y, 10y, and 30y TIPS auctions by $1bln. While the majority of the Committee supported increasing the size of the 30y TIPS auction, some members thought holding the current size steady would be preferred, citing a more limited buyer base and rising term premia.\n\nIn discussing issuance recommendations, the Committee uniformly encouraged Treasury to consider removing or modifying the forward guidance on nominal coupon and FRN auction sizes that has been in the refunding statement for the past four quarters. Some members preferred dropping the language altogether to reflect the uncertain outlook, though the majority preferred moderating the language at this meeting. Universally, the Committee felt that any shift in language should not be read to indicate an expected near-term increase in nominal coupon auction sizes, consistent with the TBAC recommended financing tables and Treasury’s objective to be regular and predictable. Members noted elevated uncertainty regarding macroeconomic developments and the fiscal trajectory and observed that current primary dealer assumptions and issuance levels imply a $1.5T cumulative funding shortfall over the next three years. As always, Treasury should maintain flexibility in future issuance decisions.\n\nAway from economic events, the Committee emphasized the risk that debt limit constraints could hamper the efficient financing of the government at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer. These episodes can cause significant economic uncertainty, affect financial markets, and impact US credit ratings. As noted in letters written both as part of the Quarterly Refunding process, but also independently in 2011, 2016, 2021, and 2023,[1] lack of resolution of the debt limit runs the risk of undermining the foundation of the US Treasury market.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nDeirdre K. Dunn\n\nChair, Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee\n\nMohit Mittal\n\nVice Chair, Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee\n\n[1]https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financing-the-government/quarterly-refunding/treasury-borrowing-advisory-committee-tbac",
    "Press Releases\nEconomy Statement for the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee\nNovember 3, 2025\nEconomic data received through September 30, 2025, suggest that U.S. economic growth solidified in the third quarter of 2025 with steady business investment and consumer demand. Stock markets reached record highs during the quarter—and have set additional highs since—while earnings growth has been stable. Meanwhile, yields on U.S. Treasury notes and bills eased over the third quarter: the average yield on the 91-day bill was 11 basis points lower from the second quarter, while the 10-year note yield was 10 basis points lower. Yields have eased further over the last month, nearing 4.00 percent for both the 91-day and the 10-year issuances.\n\nLabor markets stabilized in July and August, with modest employment growth consistent with that of the second quarter. Forced deportation and voluntary self-deportation of illegal immigrants has reduced labor supply, but labor demand has similarly decreased. This has kept aggregate labor markets roughly in balance. With modest hiring but low layoff rates, firms appear to be planning for output growth via productivity improvements.\n\nPrivate-sector forecasters estimate that, given data released for July and August, total economic growth remained solid in the third quarter. According to the most recent publicly available survey (the Wall Street Journal quarterly survey published on October 12, 2025), the median forecast for third-quarter GDP growth was 2.7 percent at an annual rate – an upswing from the July survey median of 1.0 percent annualized growth. This upward revision reflects monthly data that suggests strong private final domestic demand.\n\nThe lapse in government funding has delayed surveys and reports that are used to estimate GDP for the third quarter of 2025. As such, official data on real GDP growth last quarter will not be available until after normal government operations resume.\n\nLabor market data was relatively steady in the first two quarters of the third quarter (see Table 1 – Labor Market Indicators). Monthly job growth moderated slightly, while the average unemployment rate ticked up only slightly and the average headline labor force participation rate (LFPR) ticked down.\n\nInflation remained above the target of 2 percent in the third quarter (see Table 2 – Inflation Indicators). As of September 2025, inflation—as measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI)—was 3.0 percent on a twelve-month basis. The elevated annual growth partly reflects the strong price pressures from September 2024 to January 2025, in which headline CPI rose by 4.1 percent at an annualized rate. From January 2025 to September 2025, CPI growth was more moderate at 2.5 percent at an annual rate.\n\nMonthly core CPI inflation averaged 0.3 percent in the third quarter. Over the twelve months through September 2025, the core inflation rate was 3.0 percent. So far this year, annual core inflation has ranged between 2.8 percent and 3.1 percent, save for the 3.3 percent rating realized in January from when President Trump assumed office.\n\nInflation as measured by the PCE price index has notable differences in weights and methodologies versus the CPI. Over the past 20 years, twelve-month CPI inflation has exceeded PCE inflation by about 0.36 percentage points on average. Over the year through August 2025, headline PCE inflation was 2.7 percent, or 0.2 percentage points below headline CPI inflation for that month. Similarly, core PCE inflation was 2.9 percent, below the 3.1 percent inflation rate as measured by the CPI.\n\nLooking ahead to the next few quarters, the outlook for the U.S. economy faces upside and downside risks. However, on balance, economists view the risk of a recession as relatively low. According to The Wall Street Journal’s quarterly survey of economists, the median economist projected a 33 percent chance of a recession in the next twelve months, little changed from the 35 percent chance estimated by the median economist in the July survey.\n\nFederal government shutdown: As of October 31, the federal government has been shut down for over four weeks, and the lapse in government funding is likely to continue for at least a fifth week. The shutdown reduces current quarter GDP growth through several channels: a direct channel of lost output from furloughed workers, a secondary consumption channel as excepted and furloughed federal workers await delayed paychecks, and ancillary impacts on complementary industries (such as government contractors and local services). Each week of this unnecessary shutdown adds drag to fourth quarter GDP and introduces downside risk to the near-term outlook.\n\nLabor markets: Excluding the shutdown, declining government employment may create a headwind for labor markets in the fourth quarter of 2025. Roughly 150,000 federal employees opted into the Deferred Resignation Program to be put on administrative leave through September 30, 2025, after which they would voluntarily separate from the federal government. Thus, the employment report for October could show a decline in total payroll employment unless these employees had their resignation date postponed, were recalled from administrative leave upon agency reconsideration of staffing needs, or had found replacement jobs. The drag on job growth, however, could be mitigated to the extent that employees found other employment.\n\nAside from the government sector, Treasury is monitoring private-sector labor market developments closely. Although employment growth slowed in the second and third quarters of 2025, data do not indicate the slower growth is a result of soft GDP growth or weakening aggregate demand. Rather, labor supply and labor demand appear to have softened at the same time, leading to soft hiring without a sharp rise in unemployment. This is likely due to a lower breakeven rate of payroll job growth given the sharp drop in population growth that accompanied the Administration’s enforcement of immigration law.\n\nIndeed, labor markets appear to remain in balance as labor demand has softened with easing supply. Since early 2022, the private sector hires rate has trended lower and was 3.5 percent as of August 2025, comparable to the slow recovery from the 2007 to 2009 recession. Even so, layoff rates also remain low with the private-sector layoff and discharges rate at just 1.2 percent in August 2025, below the 1.6 percent average from 2001 to 2019, just before the pandemic. With modest hiring but low layoff rates, firms appear to be shedding labor via attrition and planning on productivity to drive output growth. Further supporting for the continued balance in the labor market at a lower breakeven rate is the stable, low levels of initial and continuing jobless claims.\n\nEnergy prices and geopolitical uncertainty: Geopolitical uncertainty, such as the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine, continues to add upside risk to the medium-term inflation outlook. Energy prices are one of the most volatile categories of inflation, with geopolitical events leading to large swings in the energy prices. For example, the CPI for gasoline rose 3.7 percent (15.9 percent at an annual rate) from June to September, accounting for over 10 percent of quarterly CPI inflation. High energy prices eventually feed through to other consumer goods and services, such as food (through fertilizer and fuel for farming equipment) and airfares.\n\nArtificial intelligence: Firms’ continued investment in artificial intelligence has significant potential to be a catalyst for productivity and economic growth—particularly for efficiency gains in service-sector industries where productivity growth historically has been slower than manufacturing industries. However, the timeline for when such boosts are realized, as well as the magnitude of said impetus, is still uncertain. If the integration of artificial intelligence boosts growth as a standard technology improvements, the productivity growth could return to historical norms after several years of above-trend growth. On the other hand, artificial intelligence could prove transformational and permanently upshift the path of productivity as it enables workers to build skills and human capital faster than in the past.\n\nArtificial intelligence also could have disruptive impacts on the economy and labor markets as businesses and individuals integrate it or fail to. Firms that are slow to adapt to the technology could find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, as could workers that delay incorporating artificial intelligence to improve their skills growth and productivity.\n\nThus far in President Trump’s second term, the Administration has successfully stewarded major fiscal legislation to prevent a historic tax increase, and it continues to seek further cuts to federal spending and incentivize productive business investment. Ongoing trade negotiations are transforming trade relationships, which will put American citizens first and prevent other countries from taking advantage of the openness of our economy. Moreover, supply-side policies, deregulation, and other reforms will protect the American consumer from high inflation, supply-chain disruptions, and the destabilizing potential of geo-political strife while freeing up investment funds for more productive uses and encouraging a significant increase in domestic energy production. In just a short six months, the Administration has made extensive progress to enact an agenda that will bring prosperity to all Americans.\n\nAverage Monthly Change(thousands)\n\n2025Q2\n\n2025Jul & Aug\n\nCY2024\n\n55\n\n51\n\n168\n\nPrivate Sector\n\n58\n\n58\n\n130\n\nGovernment\n\n-4\n\n-7\n\n38\n\nMonthly Average\n\n2025Q2\n\n2025Jul & Aug\n\nCY2024\n\n4.2\n\n4.3\n\n4.0\n\n62.4\n\n62.3\n\n62.6\n\nPrime-Age (Ages 25 to 54)\n\n83.5\n\n83.6\n\n83.6\n\nMonthly Average\n\n2025Q2\n\n2025Jul & Aug\n\nCY2024\n\n7.5\n\n7.2\n\n7.8\n\nVacancies per Unemployed Person\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nSources.

    "Press Releases\nStatement of Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin United States Department of the Treasury Before the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government United States Senate\nJuly 26, 2017\n(Archived Content)\n\n​Chairwoman Capito, Ranking Member Coons, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to meet today. I look forward to working with this subcommittee on funding key priorities for the benefit of the American people.One of the President’s promises to the American taxpayer was that he would make sure that their money is spent wisely. A budget should not be an end in itself, but a means of improving the lives of Americans. More money does not necessarily translate into better policy. The President has challenged every agency and department to identify greater efficiencies and savings that can be realized both immediately and in the coming years.The Administration is proud to submit a budget that achieves this goal. This budget makes some difficult choices because of necessary constraints. We carefully evaluated the allocation of resources to each of the Department’s important functions and made prudential reductions where needed. These choices in no way diminish our ability to operate the government effectively. The President has made it clear: national security is a top priority, and in accordance, Treasury’s request prioritizes national security and cyber security programs.Another top goal of Treasury is creating sustained economic growth. This much-needed growth will be achieved through a combination of tax reform, regulatory reform, and trade. We will work with Congress to pass legislation that allows American taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. If we develop the right policies today, we will secure a prosperous future for our children and grandchildren. The difference between recent sluggish growth and a return to 3% or higher GDP growth is trillions of dollars into the economy – making a meaningful difference in the lives of all Americans.This budget prioritizes funding for Treasury’s wide array of economic and financial tools, including sanctions. As our enemies have changed, so too have our weapons to combat them. We are honing the economic and financial tools in our arsenal to disrupt the financial resources and procurement capabilities of those who wish to do us harm. This includes actions against destabilizing regimes, terrorist networks, and drug traffickers. Stopping the flow of funding to dangerous non-state actors, working with foreign partners to keep their financial systems secure, protecting our own financial system – these key programs are critical to the continued safety and stability of the nation.Protecting Treasury and the financial system from cyber attacks is critical to our financial stability. Cyber attacks against our agency or the financial system have the potential to impact markets, the economy, and our national security. The Cybersecurity Enhancement Account makes investments in enterprise-wide cybersecurity capabilities that allow Treasury to better defend against cyber attacks and more efficiently respond and recover when they do occur. This account also makes investments in critical infrastructure protection, allowing Treasury to work collaboratively with the financial services sector to increase their operational resilience.In recent months, our office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence agreed with Gulf counterparts on the intent to establish the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC), a bold new initiative to fight terrorist financing. The TFTC is a key outcome from the President’s summit in Saudi Arabia and will enhance cooperation with Gulf countries. It will support the Administration’s priorities to fight terrorism, counter Iran’s malign influence, and deprive terrorists globally of access to the Gulf countries. We are working within the Administration on a plan for the TFTC and will be coming to Congress soon with additional details, including resource needs.As I mentioned earlier, tax and regulatory reform are marquee items for economic growth and job creation. It has been over 30 years since we have had comprehensive tax reform in this country. We are committed to changing that. Such reform means a simplified code that will provide simpler taxes and relief to middle income Americans, while making our businesses competitive again.We have taken a comprehensive approach to regulatory relief, meeting with hundreds of people across the financial industry, including community, regional, and large financial institutions, consumer advocacy groups, academics, think tanks, trade groups, and insurers. We have heard about what works and what does not work. Our reforms will spur economic growth by increasing access to credit, providing relief for community banks, and making regulations more efficient, effective, and appropriately applied. We will do this while ensuring that our financial system is secure and stable and does not put taxpayers at risk.We have an opportunity to do great things for the American people and I look forward to working with members of this subcommittee on these important issues. Thank you very much and I am happy to answer your questions.",

    "Statements & Remarks\nRemarks of Sigal P. Mandelker Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the 2019 Days of Remembrance Ceremony United States Capitol\nApril 29, 2019\nGood morning Members of Congress, Holocaust Survivors, colleagues and friends.  I remember attending this ceremony nearly a quarter century ago, and to be here today, delivering this keynote speech is incredibly humbling. I want to thank the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Council, Sara Bloomfield, Stacy Burdett, and others for inviting me.\n\nAs I stand here, I can feel the presence of my grandparents who did not survive the Holocaust and those who did, of my wonderful mother who we lost nearly 14 years ago, and of my inspirational father who is watching the speech by livestream.\n\nAs the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, I have the great honor of deploying the United States’ economic authorities, including sanctions, against a wide range of national security and illicit finance threats.  We have used these authorities to target corrupt actors and human rights abusers around the world, including from Syria and Iran to Venezuela and Nicaragua to South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and elsewhere.  Hundreds of times in the past two years, we have isolated from the financial system those who commit grave human rights abuses or plunder their countries for personal gain.\n\nOur objective is to change behavior, inspire democracy and freedom, and disrupt the ability of kleptocrats, human rights abusers, and others from stealing the wealth of their country.  We work every day to balance those tools in support of and alongside humanitarian needs.  We want to keep funding from the dictators and despots who use violence to retain power and wealth while supporting those who suffer tremendously at the hands of destructive leaders.\n\nWe have a great tradition of this at the Treasury Department.  It is a history that was chronicled in a terrific book by Dr. Rebecca Erbelding, a historian at the Museum, called “Rescue Board:  The Untold Story of America’s Efforts to Save the Jews of Europe.”\n\nThis history began on April 9, 1940, when immediately after Nazi Germany invaded Denmark and Norway, then Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau called the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and asked him to freeze the accounts of Denmark and Norway in order to immediately block Hitler’s access to those funds.  “Just freeze them,” Morgenthau said.  The following day, President Roosevelt issued an Executive Order formally prohibiting transactions relating to Denmark and Norway, unless the Treasury Department issued a license authorizing a transaction.\n\nIn the ensuing months, as other countries were invaded, Treasury would do the same to U.S.-held assets of those countries.  Treasury managed to freeze billions of dollars, keeping that money out of the hands of the Nazis and other enemies.  This effort was led by 31 year-old John Pehle, the director of the newly-created Foreign Funds Control department, which is the predecessor office to one of the components I now oversee, the Office of Foreign Assets Control.  The United States was using its economic might long before it entered the war militarily.  Morgenthau called this the “unseen front.”\n\nThe Treasury Department didn’t stop there.  In the summer of 1943, the World Jewish Congress asked the Treasury Department for a license to allow funds into Nazi-occupied Europe to help save Jews.  The idea for this license came from Gerhart Riegner, the author of the now famous Riegner cable that alerted Americans to the Nazi’s Final Solution to murder Jews.  Treasury had received similar requests for licenses to send humanitarian aid, but they had always feared that it was too dangerous to send the funds lest they end up in the wrong hands.  It wasn’t until John Pehle was informed that these funds would be used to help Jewish children in hiding in France to escape that Treasury officials decided to issue the license, so long as there were safeguards in place.\n\nUnfortunately, it would take months to effectuate the license as the effort met strong resistance from the State Department, where we now know officials had hidden news of the massacre of millions of Jews and others.\n\nDuring that long struggle with the State Department, Pehle and others began to learn more about the mass murders underway in Europe.\n\nAfter they learned of the deeply disturbing efforts to hide these atrocities, Treasury staff told Morgenthau.  This was January 1944.  This would lead Morgenthau within days to appeal directly to President Roosevelt to take action to rescue Jews and others being hunted by Hitler.  President Roosevelt agreed and established the War Refugee Board in January 1944, ultimately assigning its leadership to those Treasury officials who, when they learned about the genocide underway in Europe, stood up to do the right thing.  The War Refugee Board’s work resulted in saving tens of thousands of people and assisting many more.\n\nWhen I learned about the efforts of those dedicated Treasury Department officials nearly 80 years ago, I was overwhelmed.\n\nAt the very same moment that those Treasury officials were providing support to the effort to help Jewish children escape, my parents were Jewish children in hiding in Eastern Europe.  They were hiding underground, in forests, in ditches and under haystacks.  I grew up hearing their stories, including about moments of great courage, some of which resulted in survival and others that ended in death.\n\nIt was around 1943 and 1944 when my mom was hiding in the woods with her mother and her two aunts.  On one particular day, my grandmother — who was biologically my great-aunt but who would raise my mother after her mother died as a result of the Holocaust — was carrying my mother on her back.  My mother was four or five at the time.  They had been in hiding for months.  They were walking through a cemetery when my grandmother decided that she had had enough and she said, “I want to walk to the road and have the Germans catch us and end our lives.”  My mother, a young child, responded, “No, you are old, you have lived your life.  But I am young and I have not yet lived mine.”  As my grandmother would later tell the story, she answered my mom with fierce conviction in her voice, “No, I will not throw you to the Germans.  We will continue.”  For the rest of her life, my grandmother, who was then probably in her early 20s, credited my mom, this little girl, for saving their lives.\n\nMy father recalls the last time he saw his mother.  It was around 1942.  She was in a carriage, heading off to the town of Dubno and he remembers watching as she rode away.  She had volunteered to go to Dubno to get documents that could have helped protect her sister.  During her journey, my grandmother stayed overnight with members of her family in Dubno.  That night, the Germans liquidated that part of the Dubno ghetto where she was staying.  My grandmother was able to find a hiding spot with others.  But after it got quiet, early the next morning, my brave grandmother decided to leave, despite warnings that she could be killed.  That was the last time anyone would see her.\n\nThere were many times my parents came perilously close to death.  My father recalls as a child running in the woods away from German soldiers who were shouting and shooting.  He vividly remembers hearing a single shot and then a Jewish man cry out.  My dad and others quickly ran to hide under thick bushes by the side of a road.  They could hear the German soldiers nearby.  Eventually, my dad and the others decided to move, to try to escape.  As my dad crawled to the edge of the bushes, he saw a German soldier very close to him, looking around, with his rifle ready to shoot.  My dad motioned for those behind him to stay down.  The German soldiers did not find them that day, but there is no question that any slip or sound would have meant that neither he nor I would be here today.\n\nI also grew up hearing about the righteous people who risked and gave their lives to save my parents.  There was the farmer my grandfather worked for who woke my father and others early one morning and told them to quickly run away because the Germans were coming.  There was the couple who allowed my mom and others to hide in a ditch on their property for months.  They would feed my mom and her family at night.  They were killed later for hiding Jews.\n\nWhen you grow up as the child of survivors, these stories of survival, ultimate sacrifice, and courage live with you every day.  You imagine yourself in the position of your grandparents, with the responsibility of protecting children, running and hiding in the forest and you pray that you would find the strength to carry them through the woods.\n\nThis past weekend, all of our lives were once again hit with tragic anti-Semitism at Chabad of Poway.  The breaking news of another synagogue attack sent shockwaves through our community.  We have heard stories of intense bravery as congregants put themselves at risk to save others and law enforcement sprang into action.\n\nThis shooting took place exactly six months after the horrific massacre at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill, where we likewise heard of great acts of courage from first responders and fellow congregants.  There were three congregations holding services in Tree of Life on the morning of that attack, October 27, 2018.  One was Dor Hadash, the congregation that I grew up in.\n\nDor Hadash is a congregation that has always focused on community, on values, on study, and on participation.  Until just a few years ago, nearly every week, my father attended that particular Shabbat service that the gunman attacked.  During a memorial service after the shooting, Rabbi Cheryl Klein, the cantor of Dor Hadash, described our congregation as a “small but mighty congregation that is composed of seekers, learners, lovers, and doers.”\n\nWhether in the 1940s or today, it is imperative that we continue to come together as a community, to participate, to be seekers, to be doers, to have courage.\n\nWhat does that mean for those of us in public service?\n\nFor me, it means that we must constantly remember that somewhere in the world today there is a child and a mother, wandering the forest, with no place to go other than a hiding spot in a ditch or a refugee camp surrounded by guards.  For some, the Holocaust feels like a distant memory.  For those survivors in the room, it has never left your side and, as it has for my father for many years, it may come alive again in your nightmares.\n\nFor many around the world today, who suffer starvation, torture, murder and other grave deprivation, it is, in another form, their reality.\n\nFor those of us in the Treasury Department, public service requires that we constantly strive to cut off the funds that enable those who commit these heinous acts.  It requires that we use sanctions just as Secretary Morgenthau ordered in 1940, to freeze the assets of despots and dictators.  It requires that we use the full force of our diplomatic might and that we grant humanitarian licenses to help those suffering, just as the Treasury Department did so many years ago for those Jewish children in hiding.\n\nAs public servants, we have to constantly challenge ourselves to use these authorities wisely, to be smart, strategic and tactical, to have courage, to be brave, and always compassionate.  We must make sure that we are not choosing the tactics that make us feel like we are making a difference as some may have been lulled into doing 80 years ago — we must use the tools that in practice make that difference.\n\nThank you.",

    "Statements & Remarks\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen on International Priorities to The Chicago Council on Global Affairs\nApril 5, 2021\nAmerica is strongest when we engage with the world.\n\nWhen I was born, the United States was still recovering from the Great Depression and World War II. These tragedies cost countless lives; too many families lost nearly everything. But from the devastation we learned an invaluable lesson: the United States must not go it alone.\n\nIn the aftermath of the destruction, the United States built strong political and security alliances that have helped keep our country safe and helped our economies flourish. We created global institutions, such as the United Nations, and financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, to reduce economic conflict and address global poverty. With strong U.S. leadership—and working together with our allies—we contained communism and created a dynamic world economy and growing markets for U.S. exports. America’s middle class prospered. Millions across the world were lifted out of poverty.\n\nBut over the years, new problems developed that were not properly addressed. In the push to grow our economies, we neglected our environment. As we embraced new technologies, we didn’t do enough to prepare our workers and our education systems for the changes underway. While we embraced trade as an engine for growth, we neglected those who did not benefit. And in the most recent period, when we might have adopted policies at home to face these issues and joined with our allies to address issues abroad, we isolated ourselves and retreated from the international order that we created.\n\nOver the last four years, we have seen firsthand what happens when America steps back from the global stage. America first must never mean America alone. For in today’s world, no country alone can suitably provide a strong and sustainable economy for its people. Over time, a lack of global leadership and engagement makes our institutions and economy vulnerable.\n\nTo make matters worse, COVID-19 struck. The virus has taken over 550 thousand American lives—our family members, our friends, our neighbors—and millions more around the world. We did not respond sufficiently last year to address the devastating health crisis at home and failed to engage early to address the crisis beyond our borders. And with the health crisis came the economic crisis. We sought to protect those most vulnerable, but millions of workers lost their jobs and all too many small businesses shuttered. Women and people of color bore the brunt of the economic hardship, exacerbating century-long inequalities that plague our society.\n\nWe can do better. We must do better.\n\nThe American people elected President Biden and Vice President Harris to tackle these challenges—the pandemic, the economic crisis, a hollowing of the middle class, systemic racism, deepening inequality, and climate change. To not just return us to life as it was before the pandemic but to build back better, creating a prosperous economy for all.\n\nCredibility abroad begins with credibility at home. How can America help lead the world out of the dual crises of pandemic and economic recession if we can’t lead ourselves out of it? It’s a fair question, and it’s why last month, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law.\n\nThe rescue plan is easily the largest relief package since the Great Depression. It includes powerful measures—rental assistance, unemployment insurance, direct payments—to help Americans make it to the other side of this crisis. And this package is designed not only to help our economy survive the scars of the pandemic, but to create a foundation for our economy to thrive.\n\nThe work has already begun. In less than four weeks, this administration issued more than 130 million vital relief payments to individuals and families. We provided more than 100 million vaccine shots in just 58 days.\n\nBut we have more to do. Last week, President Biden outlined a plan to Rebuild America, creating a more sustainable and more resilient economy with a 21st century infrastructure. The plan will fix America’s crumbling highways and bridges; upgrade ports, airports, and transit systems; build a renewed electric grid; deliver high-speed broadband to all Americans; and invest in basic research and science. It proposes affordable and accessible caretaking options for older Americans and our nation’s children, and an education system that trains our workers to thrive in the modern global economy.\n\nBeyond our borders, as the pandemic has made clearer than ever before, the global community is in this together. We will fare better if we work together and support each other.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to restoring U.S. leadership in the multilateral system to help make the world economy stronger and advance American interests. The United States needs to have a strong presence in global markets on a level playing field. We will cooperate with willing partners to protect and enforce a rules-based order. Our economic relationship with China, like our broader relationship with China, will be competitive where it should be, collaborative where it can be, and adversarial where it must be.\n\nWe will defend democracy and the human rights of all people—of women and girls, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people of every race, ethnic background, and religion—to help ensure that those rights are protected at home and abroad. In all our international engagements, President Biden and I will stand up for the American people and American business—as well as these core values that define America.\n\nI would like to spend time today discussing three key objectives that guide our economic engagement with the rest of the world, which I believe are necessary to help realize the vision of our nation.\n\nFor the United States to prosper, our neighbors too must prosper. In the modern world, recession, instability, and crime abroad find ways to wash upon our shore. Strong and stable economies abroad make us safer. We will benefit if countries can maintain or create economic, social, and political conditions favorable to an open society. We will benefit if individuals around the world can pursue their aspirations, regardless of conditions of birth, and if women have truly equal rights and opportunity to be included in the economy. We will benefit if people—while retaining cultural differences—share core values of free speech, free exercise of religion, and respect for diversity.\n\nOf course, stronger growth abroad also means a stronger economy here at home. As other economies prosper, demand for U.S. exports of goods and service increase, creating jobs. When developing countries are economically successful, their growing populations and rising living standards mean a higher consumer base for the United States. In 1990, 40 percent of U.S. exports went to emerging economies. By 2020, it was 60 percent. This demand for American products creates U.S. jobs that pay better. Studies have shown that women, in particular, could earn as much as 20 percent more in these export-based jobs.\n\nAt the time of the global financial crisis in 2008, we learned that an interconnected economy brings vulnerabilities. Post-crisis reforms have strengthened global banks and reduced systemic risks, but vulnerabilities, particularly in the nonbank financial sector, remain. So, as we pursue a stronger world economy, we must also pay attention to existing financial stability risks and new risks that may arise. To do so, rather than retreat, we must closely coordinate with our partners. We should aim to mitigate risks and promote a sound financial system at home and abroad, so that Americans have steady access to the finance needed to build back better—money to start a new business, to buy a home, and to create wealth for themselves and their children.\n\nUnless we act now, the world is susceptible to the emergence of a deepening global divergence between rich and poor countries. This threat, which has never been more pressing, will likely result from divergent capabilities to contain the virus and bring about economic recovery.\n\nLike the United States, rich countries and some large emerging markets have had the means to support their economies while they pursue a health solution. And, like the United States, they have gained access to vaccination. Of course, it is too early for advanced economies to declare victory. I am urging our partners to continue a strong fiscal effort and avoid withdrawing support too early, to promote a strong recovery and help avoid the emergence of global imbalances.\n\nMany middle and low-income countries are in a different place, lacking the finance to support their economies and people during COVID-19 and constrained in their wherewithal to obtain vaccines.\n\nThe result will likely be a deeper and longer-lasting crisis, with mounting problems of indebtedness, more entrenched poverty, and growing inequality. Their crises will push as many as 150 million into extreme poverty this year, reversing the trends of the last two decades, with women, youth, low-skilled and informal workers particularly hard hit. Moreover, an additional 120 million people became acutely food insecure in 2020, and that trend could worsen.\n\nThis would be a profound economic tragedy for those countries, one we should care about. But, that’s obvious. What’s less obvious—but equally true—is that this divergence would also be a problem for America. With few exceptions, stable and prosperous economies tend to be less of a security threat to the United Sates. And, the human crisis of refugees and migrants will only be solved if we have stable and secure growth in the rest of the world.\n\nSo how do we help the poorest countries get through this crisis?\n\nOur first task must clearly be stopping the virus by ensuring that vaccinations, testing, and therapeutics are available as widely as possible. Low-income countries risk falling to the back of the line and may not achieve widespread vaccine coverage until 2023 or 2024 at the current pace. More work and funding are needed to secure vaccine purchases, address manufacturing shortages, and finance and facilitate the domestic rollout in low-income countries.\n\nWe also need to help lessen the economic pain in low-income countries during a protracted recovery period and use this opportunity—as we are doing in the United States—to facilitate structural transformations to more inclusive and sustainable economies. The IMF and the World Bank have already played an important role on this front, and we are working to strengthen their ability to support the poorest countries. We have created a new multilateral framework to help low-income countries address unsustainable debt burdens. And at the IMF, we are working to issue $650 billion in new Special Drawing Rights, an international reserve asset, that will increase buffers for all IMF members and give low-income countries the additional liquidity for greater spending on vaccines and healthcare.\n\nEmbedded in recovery efforts, we have an interest in helping countries pursue sustainable and inclusive growth and strengthen long-term resilience. Our response will not be successful if we end up just where we were before.\n\nA personal objective of mine is to focus our international engagements on fostering full legal rights and greater economic and education opportunities for women and girls, given the clear evidence that this will support inclusive economic growth more broadly. Speaking from my own experience, we need to do better at reducing barriers for women’s economic empowerment, even unconscious ones, in nearly every country in the world, including the United States.\n\nThe most evident, immediate example is the need to address global health risks. COVID-19 has clearly shown that pandemic responses require global cooperation. We are working with our partners to enhance pandemic preparedness against future shocks. We need to learn lessons from this pandemic to be better prepared to stop future contagious diseases before they become full-scale pandemics.\n\nAnother global challenge we face is how to adapt to technological change, which has brought significant benefits but contributed to greater inequality. Digitalization is the latest technological advance that provides an opportunity to raise productivity and increase connectivity, both at home and globally. Even just a year ago, I never thought that I would regularly be joining meetings with colleagues in London, Delhi, Sydney, and everywhere in between from the comfort of my office in Treasury. But the digital divide has also exacerbated inequality, and digitalization has raised concerns about privacy, illicit activity, and threats of surveillance and cybersecurity attacks from our adversaries. I will be working domestically and closely with our allies to promote innovation in digital finance, in the interest of cheap, instantaneous, and reliable commercial and financial transactions, but also to ensure that we modernize our legal and regulatory frameworks to take account of the risks and threats inherent in the use of these new technologies.\n\nAnother consequence of an interconnected world has been a thirty-year race to the bottom on corporate tax rates. Competitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids. It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises, and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government. President Biden’s proposals announced last week call for bold domestic action, including to raise the U.S. minimum tax rate, and renewed international engagement, recognizing that it is important to work with other countries to end the pressures of tax competition and corporate tax base erosion. We are working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom. Together we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth, and prosperity.\n\nLet me end by discussing the biggest long-term threat the world faces: climate change. After sitting on the sidelines for four years, the United States is committed to doing its part. We have a narrow moment to pursue action at home and abroad to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of that crisis and to seize the opportunity that tackling climate change presents.\nPresident Biden has released a plan to combat climate change, including through rejoining the Paris Agreement, investing in sustainable infrastructure, and creating new green jobs. He has committed to release an ambitious strategy this year to outline U.S. domestic greenhouse gas targets that are consistent with our work internationally.\n\nDomestic action must go hand in hand with U.S. international leadership, aimed at significantly enhancing global action. To this end, Treasury is working closely with our international partners and international organizations to implement ambitious emissions reduction measures, protect critical ecosystems, build resilience against the impacts of climate change, and promote the flow of capital toward climate-aligned investments and away from carbon-intensive investments. We are also working to ensure that climate risk is integrated into the financial system so that financial institutions, regulators, and investors can make informed decisions. I am pleased that Treasury is co-chairing a newly launched G20 sustainable finance working group, where finance ministries and central banks will work together to identify mechanisms for promoting green investments and accelerating transition to a net-zero economy.\n\nAs I prepare to meet with my colleagues from around the world this week at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings, I find myself thinking back to the policymakers who gathered in Bretton Woods a year before I was born to define our post-war order. Though it was a different time, I empathize with the enormous weight they faced; the pressure to come together after a global catastrophe in building an enduring and interconnected system aimed at promoting peace and prosperity throughout the world. Our current juncture is no less significant—what we do in the coming months and years will have profound impacts on the trajectory of our country and on the global economic order.\n\nOf course, there are key differences from the post-war era. Maybe most noticeably, I will be joined later this week by other female finance ministers, central bank governors, and heads of international financial institutions—not enough, but a start—as well as diverse representatives from all corners of the globe. In our interconnected and digital world, and considering the pandemic, I will be logging onto a computer to join these meetings, not trekking to a mountain resort in New Hampshire.\n\nYet, the most important difference today is a fundamental recognition that our policies at home and abroad must be designed to be inclusive, tackle inequality, and respect our environment. In this context, I will use the Spring Meetings this week to: advance discussions on climate change; press our partners to do their part to support a strong global economic recovery; strengthen tools to improve vaccine access and financing for the world’s poorest countries; and increase the focus on inequality, including for vulnerable populations and women and girls.\n\nI’m honored to serve the American people once again. To listen to the underrepresented. To be bold in action. And to cooperate with our global partners to solve the challenges we face together in building the next century of prosperity.\n\n###",
    "Statements & Remarks\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at the Venice International Conference on Climate\nJuly 11, 2021\nTwenty Years after Kyoto\n\nAs prepared for delivery\n\nThank you, Ignazio, for hosting us today, and how appropriate to be in Venice. Even if this weren’t a conference about climate change, how could we not raise the issue here?\n\nFor all of us, 2020 was the year of the pandemic. But for Venice, 2019 was also the year of the flood; the canal waters, as you know, rose higher than they had in half a century. And even before that, many of the steps and statues of the old palazzos, visible when they were built centuries ago, slipped beneath the waterline.\n\nOne news story, I thought, put it quite well: Venice is a beautiful ruler; a city that measures our world’s rising sea levels – and, thus, the increasing impact of climate change.\n\nIgnazio, you and I have been trying for a long time to measure the potential costs of climate change – and advocate ways to avert them. I recall first working with you during the Kyoto Conference in the late nineties when you were at the OECD.  We formed a High Level Sustainable Development Group to involve finance ministers in climate policy.  I remember preparing my first speech on climate change not long after the conference. This was March of 1998. The U.S. Congress was holding hearings on the agreement, and the Clinton Administration needed a White House official to testify. I raised my hand.\n\nI told Congress to think of Kyoto as a form of insurance for our planet. Wouldn’t even a significant investment in transitioning our economies away from carbon be worth it if it saved priceless coastal cities like Venice? If it helped ensure that we kept the world livable? And, if we addressed climate change intelligently, the benefits would far outweigh the costs.\n\nIn the end, we all know the outcome of that prior effort.\n\nFast forward to today, I am happy to report that the landscape has changed in the United States. President Biden has committed to reduce U.S. emissions from 2005 levels by at least 50 percent by 2030, and we’re seeing a new consensus around a plan to achieve a significant portion of that reduction.\n\nIt includes thousands of miles of new transmission lines for renewable energy, upgrades to our power infrastructure, and greener transportation through accelerating domestic manufacturing of zero-emissions vehicles. And with all of our domestic investments in climate, President Biden has committed that a significant share of the benefits will go to disadvantaged communities, who historically have borne too much of the brunt of our country’s environmental pollution.\n\nI also think that the international landscape has become more favorable to making change. During Kyoto, we understood well the global challenge that climate change presented and the significant costs to the world of inaction, but we did not have the benefit of a G20 Finance Track then. We had fewer channels to coordinate across a broad group of countries on financial and economic challenges. By bringing together Finance Ministers, Central Bank Governors, and the broader international community to discuss the economic aspects of climate change, this Conference is an example of how far we have progressed in our approach over the past twenty years.\n\nI would like to spend the balance of my remarks speaking about how the United States intends to work with our international partners and on our shared responsibility to implement ambitious emissions reduction measures. Because no nation can reverse climate change alone.\n\nThis work begins with setting bold policy goals. We must enhance the ambition of the Nationally Determined Contributions that we submit to the UNFCCC and set targets for achieving net-zero emissions, consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. As Finance Ministers, we must help to develop credible domestic strategies, laws, and regulations to meet these targets. The International Financial Institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the Multilateral Development Banks, can be important partners as we seek to design robust economic and financial policies to achieve our climate goals.\n\nDeveloping countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change, with poverty, food security, and health outcomes impacted by extreme weather shocks. In this context, the United States has redoubled our efforts around the ambitious collective goal to mobilize $100 billion per year from a wide variety of public and private sources to support developing countries in undertaking adaptation and mitigation efforts.\n\nThis spring, we released America’s first-ever International Climate Finance Plan. As part of this plan, the United States intends to double, by 2024, our annual public climate finance for developing countries and to triple our public finance for climate adaptation. This would mean about $5.7 billion per year in climate finance by 2024, including $1.5 billion for adaptation. The multilateral climate funds play a key role in this plan. The Climate Investment Funds scale up targeted investments in clean technology and other areas, while the Green Climate Fund remains a centerpiece of providing impactful climate finance to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries.\n\nMultilateral Development Banks are one of the largest sources of climate finance for developing countries: The MDBs to which the United States contributes reported over $36 billion in climate finance collectively in 2020. The MDBs are also positioned well to engage the private sector in developing countries. They can target support toward the challenges in the domestic market that make it difficult for the private sector to invest at scale by advising on policies, mitigating investment risk, and providing finance.\n\nWe recognize the tremendous work the MDBs are doing in partnership with developing countries. We see the MDBs continuing to evolve their role further beyond the critical development finance they provide, including to help countries design green recovery strategies in response to the COVID-19 crisis, develop green bond markets to raise capital, and build robust enabling environments to incentivize private investment needed to meet the climate challenge.\n\nWe expect that they will continue their efforts to increase climate finance targets, fully align their lending with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and discourage new investments in fossil fuel-based power generation except where other options are not possible.\n\nBut we believe the MDBs can go further.  I plan to shortly convene the heads of the MDBs to articulate our expectations that the MDBs align their portfolios with the Paris Agreement and net-zero goals as urgently as possible. We also expect them to take steps to more effectively mobilize private capital so that developing countries can increasingly benefit from private sector pledges to support climate-aligned and sustainable investments. As leading sources of official finance, the MDBs need to maximize the catalytic impact of their support for countries seeking to confront a changing climate, and to harness the economic opportunities embedded in the transition to a low-carbon economy. I know that the MDBs have the policy expertise, relationships, and financial tools to make a substantial contribution toward our collective climate goals, and I look forward to working together to ensure that these goals are met.\n\nThe investment needed to green the global economy is enormous and far exceeds the scale of official finance. Private capital will need to fill most of that gap. This brings me to our initiatives to enable the private sector to better account for climate change when making financing decisions, which we will discuss in more depth this afternoon.\n\nThere are some positive trends in this regard. Investor demand for climate-aligned investments, including green bonds and sustainable assets, is rapidly increasing in certain markets. I am also pleased to see momentum building in financial institutions around net-zero commitments.\n\nA threshold challenge though, as you know, is imperfect information—understanding the risks and opportunities climate change presents. For example, the current financial reporting system is not producing reliable disclosures. We also need consistency of reporting frameworks over time, as well as comparability across firms and jurisdictions, providing the useful information that investors need to make informed decisions.\n\nClimate change also introduces new and increasing types of risk. The risks from more frequent and severe natural disasters—so-called physical risks—have, and will continue to become, more prominent. Then there are the risks that may accompany the technological, market, and policy changes needed to address climate change—the so-called transition risks. The emergence of\n\nthese risks challenges one of the financial sector’s most essential functions—ensuring that risk is borne by investors and institutions well placed to manage it.\n\nPresident Biden has recognized that this is a major problem that needs to be tackled now. He recently signed an Executive Order on climate-related financial risk, outlining a whole-of-government process to assess climate risk to the U.S. financial system and federal government.\n\nAs part of this process, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which I chair, will assess the potential risk that climate change may pose to the financial stability of the United States. The Executive Order also made clear this Administration’s policy to advance the disclosure of climate-related financial risks, which we will also explore through FSOC. This will complement the work of the SEC, which is currently reviewing existing guidance on climate-related financial disclosures.\n\nTreasury is also working closely with our domestic regulators as we engage in international discussions to promote effective and consistent approaches to disclosure. These efforts build on existing work to improve climate-related financial risk disclosure, like the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and other sustainability reporting organizations.\n\nIn closing, I am pleased that Treasury is co-chairing the newly reestablished G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group, which will deepen the G20’s engagement over the coming years on many of the themes I raised today.\n\nThe Working Group has an ambitious agenda for this year. In addition to developing a roadmap that will guide G20 priorities for scaling up sustainable finance, it will also focus on three topics. First, it will consider how to improve existing international initiatives and approaches to sustainability disclosure and reporting. Second, the Working Group will explore the various tools and approaches used by jurisdictions and the private sector to align finance with climate and sustainability goals and develop recommendations to enhance how they work together.  Lastly, the Working Group will help support MDB efforts to align their financing with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nSo, let me end where I began, with Kyoto in ‘97. We knew back then climate change was happening and that it was an urgent crisis that demanded our attention and action. But it’s been nearly a quarter-of-a century since, and we have not done nearly enough.\n\nWe can’t afford another 25 years of inaction or low ambition.\n\nAs we transition to the post-pandemic world, climate change has to be a challenge our global community addresses collaboratively.\n\nI know I’m not alone in thinking this way. This is a group committed to combatting climate change; we refuse to hand this problem off to the next generation.\n\nI look forward to continuing to work with all of you to make progress on this critical issue.\n\n####",
    "Press Releases\nTreasury Sanctions Public Ministry of Nicaragua and Nine Government Officials Following Sham November Elections\nNovember 15, 2021\nWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated the Public Ministry of Nicaragua (Ministerio Publico de Nicaragua) as well as nine officials of the Government of Nicaragua in response to the sham national elections orchestrated by President Daniel Ortega (Ortega) and Vice President Rosario Murillo (Murillo). This action targets those who are repressing Nicaraguans for exercising their human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nBetween October 2020 and June 2021, the Nicaraguan National Assembly, controlled by Ortega and Murillo, approved six laws that facilitated the government’s repression against the opposition and eliminated its chances in the November 2021 elections. Several officials designated in today’s action were appointed to their government positions by Ortega and are key supporters of the regime and its anti-democratic policies; the officials designated today also include multiple persons implicated in violence against peaceful protestors during Nicaragua’s 2018 demonstrations.\n\nAs President Biden stated, President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Murillo orchestrated a pantomime election that was neither free nor fair, and most certainly not democratic. The unjust imprisonment of nearly 40 opposition figures since May, including seven potential presidential candidates, and the blocking of political parties from participation rigged the outcome well before election day.\n\n“The Ortega regime is using laws and institutions to detain members of the political opposition and deprive Nicaraguans from the right to vote,” said Office of Foreign Assets Control Director Andrea M. Gacki. “The United States is sending an unequivocal message to President Ortega, Vice President Murillo, and their inner circle that we stand with the Nicaraguan people in their calls for reform and a return to democracy.”\n\nToday’s action, taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13851, “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Nicaragua,” and the Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018 (NHRAA), now known as the Nicaragua Investment Conditionality Act of 2018 (NICA), is intended to highlight the anti-democratic actions that the Ortega regime has undertaken to alter and corrupt the election process in Nicaragua and solidify the power of Ortega, Murillo and their inner circle.\n\nThe Public Ministry of Nicaragua is the federal public prosecutor’s office and is designated for being responsible for or complicit in, or for having directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Nicaragua. Relying on Nicaraguan law, including Law 1055, the Public Ministry has unjustly arrested and investigated presidential candidates and prevented them from running for office, thereby undermining democracy in Nicaragua. Law 1055 prohibits from public office anyone determined to be “traitors,” such as those advocating “foreign interference” in Nicaragua or other actions deemed to be undermining Nicaraguan sovereignty. In June 2021, the Public Ministry used Law 1055 and requested that leading opposition presidential candidate Cristiana Chamorro, whom it was investigating on groundless charges relating to “the crimes of laundering, forgery of official documents, and abusive management,” be disqualified from the electoral process. The Public Ministry also initiated investigations or filed charges against leading presidential candidates Arturo Cruz, Felix Maradiaga, Juan Sebastian Chamorro, and Miguel Mora, all of whom were detained since June of this year in the run-up to the sham November elections. The Public Ministry is also responsible for the arrest of nearly 40 individuals since late May, including leaders of civil society, the private sector, students, and journalists.\n\nLuis Angel Montenegro Espinoza (Montenegro) was designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007. As the Superintendent of the Superintendency of Banks and Other Financial Institutions (SIBOIF), Montenegro ordered banks to comply with a request from the Public Ministry to audit and turn over financial information on 13 senior executives and businessmen in accordance with Law 1055 due to being the subject of an investigation. Additionally, in April 2020, SIBOIF issued regulations implementing the February 2020 amendments to the Law for the Protection of Consumers and Users, which forbids banks in Nicaragua, without a reason recognized by Nicaraguan law, from refusing financial services to customers, including OFAC-designated persons.\n\nJose Adrian Chavarria Montenegro (Chavarria) is the Nicaraguan Vice Minister of Finance and Public Credit and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007. Chavarria replaced, as a board member of the National Electric Transmission Company, U.S.-designated Ivan Adolfo Acosta Montalvan, who arranged significant financial support to the Ortega regime.\n\nRodolfo Francisco Lopez Gutierrez is the Managing Director of the Electric Distributor of the North (DISNORTE) and Electric Distributor of the South (DISSUR) and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007.\n\nJose Antonio Castaneda Mendez is the President of Nicaraguan Institute of Energy and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007.\n\nMohamed Farrara Lashtar (Lashtar) is the Nicaraguan Ambassador to Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Lashtar is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007.\n\nSalvador Mansell Castrillo is the Nicaraguan Minister of Energy and Mines and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007.\n\nSadrach Zeledon Rocha (Zeledon) is the Mayor of the Nicaraguan city of Matagalpa and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007. Zeledon contributed to the violence inflicted against demonstrations by Nicaraguan citizens that began in April 2018. He was connected to the actions of paramilitary forces, the pro-Ortega Police, and shock groups that engaged in serious abuses against protestors.\n\nLeonidas Centeno Rivera (Centeno) is the Mayor of Jinotega and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007. Centeno is directly linked to instances of repression in Jinotega during the 2018 protests. In particular, attacks with heavy weaponry carried out by paramilitary members killed four individuals, and members of Centeno’s mayoral office staff actively participated in the repression of protestors.\n\nFrancisco Ramon Valenzuela Blandon (Valenzuela) is the Mayor of Esteli and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007. Valenzuela’s office was ordered to position snipers to target demonstrators during the protests of 2018.\n\nAs a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of these persons that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more in the aggregate by one or more of such persons are also blocked. OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all dealings by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of blocked or designated persons.\n\nThe sanctions imposed today are not intended to be permanent but are issued to encourage a positive change of behavior by the identified persons and the authoritarian regime they support. The United States makes clear that the removal of sanctions may be available for individuals and entities designated pursuant to E.O. 13851 and the NHRAA who take concrete and meaningful actions to promote democracy and the rule of law in Nicaragua.\n\nView identifying information on the entity and individuals designated today.\n\n###",

Yellen on the President’s Fiscal Year 2023 Budget and Treasury Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2022-2026\nMarch 28, 2022\nThe President’s Budget requests $20.5 billion in discretionary resources for the Department of the Treasury’s domestic and international programs to support a fair and equitable tax system, expand access to capital in disadvantaged communities, advance the President’s historic climate finance pledge, and safeguard the financial system.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Biden-Harris Administration today submitted to Congress the President’s Budget for FY 2023 and Treasury published its Strategic Plan for FY 2022-2026. The President’s Budget details his vision to expand on the historic progress our country has made over the last year and deliver the agenda he laid out in his State of the Union address—to build a better America, reduce the deficit, lower costs for families, and grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out.\n\n“President Biden’s Fiscal Year 2023 Budget aspires to improve the livelihoods of working families and keep our economy globally competitive and includes investments that will help achieve both those goals,” U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said. “Last year, we experienced a rapid recovery with historic job creation and economic growth. This economic rebound allows us to look beyond the pandemic-induced crisis and provide a roadmap to address future challenges: creating a tax system that is fair to working families, expanding access to capital in disadvantaged communities, and safeguarding the financial system. In addition to the Budget, Treasury’s newly released Strategic Plan outlines the Department’s long-term goals to promote equitable economic growth, enhance national security, protect financial stability and resiliency, combat climate change, and modernize Treasury operations.”\n\nThe Budget makes critical investments in the American people that will help lay a stronger foundation for shared growth and prosperity for generations to come, aligning resources to implement the goals in the Treasury Strategic Plan.

    "Readouts\nREADOUT: At Strategic Dialogue on Illicit Finance, United States and Mexico Agree to Work on Anti-Corruption, Revitalize Illicit Finance Cooperation\nMay 13, 2022\nMEXICO CITY – The United States and Mexico committed to establish a working group on anti-corruption, focused primarily on a high-level strategic response to public corruption and in line with current Treasury efforts and the Biden Administration’s December 2021 “U.S. Strategy on Countering Corruption.” In May 2022, delegations from the United States and Mexico convened the Strategic Dialogue on Illicit Finance (SDIF) to advance anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) goals established under the U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework. In support of the U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework, officials agreed to continue expanding information-sharing to bolster bilateral efforts to counter illicit finance.\n\nAssistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes Elizabeth Rosenberg co-chaired the meeting with Mexico’s Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) Director Pablo Gomez Alvarez.  The U.S. delegation to the SDIF included Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Acting Director Himamauli Das, representatives from the Department of Justice, Internal Revenue Service, and other U.S. government agencies.  Mexico has been one of the United States’ closest partners in combatting illicit finance and the dialogue, first established in 2014, has been a key bilateral operational forum for law enforcement and AML supervisory and policy officials. This was the first in-person SDIF since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAt the dialogue, participants discussed how to move forward on major issue areas such as narcotics smuggling, evolving illicit finance threats, human smuggling and trafficking, corruption, and virtual assets. Assistant Secretary Rosenberg reaffirmed Treasury’s commitment to work with Mexican partners to target the financial networks of transnational criminal organizations and corrupt individuals.  Officials also agreed to revitalize joint work to target human traffickers and trade-based money launderers given the threat they pose to both countries.",
    "Press Releases\nTreasury Sanctions Senior Liberian Government Officials for Public Corruption\nAugust 15, 2022\nWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Liberian government officials Nathaniel McGill, Sayma Syrenius Cephus, and Bill Twehway for their involvement in ongoing public corruption in Liberia. These officials are designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world.\n\n“Through their corruption these officials have undermined democracy in Liberia for their own personal benefit,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. “Treasury’s designations today demonstrate that the United States remains committed to holding corrupt actors accountable and to the continued support of the Liberian people.”\n\nCorruption has long undermined Liberia’s democracy and its economy, robbing the Liberian people of funds for public services, empowering illicit actors, degrading the business environment, and damaging the rule of law and effective governance in the country. Corruption also contributes to diminished confidence in government and public perception of impunity for those with power. These designations reaffirm the commitment of the United States to hold corrupt actors accountable. The United States is a proud and dedicated partner and friend of Liberia and stands with the people of Liberia in support of democracy and the rule of law and will continue to promote accountability for corrupt actors, regardless of their position or political affiliation. The United States is also committed to working with the people and Government of Liberia to elevate countering corruption as a priority, including by bolstering public sector anti-corruption capacity, and reviewing and re-evaluating criteria for bilateral and multilateral assistance, including around transparency and accountability. Holding corrupt actors accountable and bolstering anti-corruption efforts are both consistent with, and reflects our commitment to implementing, the United States Strategy on Countering Corruption.\n\nNathaniel McGill (McGill) is Minister of State for Presidential Affairs and Chief of Staff to President George Weah. During his tenure in government, McGill has bribed business owners, received bribes from potential investors, and accepted kickbacks for steering contracts to companies in which he has an interest. McGill has manipulated public procurement processes in order to award multi-million dollar contracts to companies in which he has ownership, including by abusing emergency procurement processes to rig contract bids. McGill is credibly accused of involvement in a wide range of other corrupt schemes including soliciting bribes from government office seekers and misappropriating government assets for his personal gain. He has used government funds allocated to other Liberian government institutions to run his own projects, made off-the-books payments in cash to senior government leaders, and organized warlords to threaten political rivals. McGill has received an unjustified stipend from various Liberian government institutions and used his position to prevent his misappropriation from being discovered. McGill regularly distributes thousands of dollars in undocumented cash to other government officials for government and non-government activities.\n\nMcGill is being designated for being a foreign person who is a current government official who is responsible for or complicit in, or who has directly or indirectly engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nSayma Syrenius Cephus (Cephus) is the current Solicitor General and Chief Prosecutor of Liberia. Cephus has developed close relationships with suspects of criminal investigations and has received bribes from individuals in exchange for having their cases dropped. Cephus has worked behind the scenes to establish arrangements with subjects of money laundering investigations to cease investigations in order to personally benefit financially. He shields money launderers and helps clear them through the court system and has intimidated other prosecutors in an attempt to quash investigations. Cephus has also utilized his position to hinder investigations and block the prosecution of corruption cases involving members of the government. Cephus has been accused of tampering with and purposefully withholding evidence in cases involving members of opposition political parties to ensure conviction.\n\nCephus is being designated for being a foreign person who is a current government official who is responsible for or complicit in, or who has directly or indirectly engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nBill Twehway (Twehway) is the current Managing Director of the National Port Authority (NPA). Twehway orchestrated the diversion of $1.5 million in vessel storage fee funds from the NPA into a private account. Twehway secretly formed a private company to which, through his position at the NPA, he later unilaterally awarded a contract for loading and unloading cargo at the Port of Buchanan. The contract was awarded to the company less than a month after its founding. Twehway and others used family members to obfuscate their own involvement in the company while still benefitting financially from the company.\n\nTwehway is being designated for being a foreign person who is a current government official who is responsible for or complicit in, or has directly or indirectly engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nAs a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of these targets that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons must be blocked and reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all dealings by U.S. persons or within the United States (including transactions transiting the United States) that involve any property or interests in property of blocked or designated persons.\n\nIn addition, persons that engage in certain transactions with the individuals and entities designated today may themselves be exposed to sanctions or subject to an enforcement action. Furthermore, unless an exception applies, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates a significant transaction for any of the individuals or entities designated today could be subject to U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.\n\nBuilding upon the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, E.O. 13818 was issued on December 20, 2017, in recognition that the prevalence of human rights abuse and corruption that have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States, had reached such scope and gravity as to threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; and undermine economic markets. The United States seeks to impose tangible and significant consequences on those who commit serious human rights abuse or engage in corruption, as well as to protect the financial system of the United States from abuse by these same persons.\n\nIdentifying information on the individuals designated today.\n\n###",

    "Press Releases\nFinancial Stability Oversight Council Releases 2022 Annual Report\nDecember 16, 2022\nWASHINGTON – The Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) today unanimously approved its 2022 annual report.  The report notes that, amid heightened geopolitical and economic shocks and inflation, risks to the U.S. economy and financial stability have increased even as the financial system has exhibited resilience.  The annual report reviews financial market developments, describes potential emerging threats to U.S. financial stability, identifies vulnerabilities in the financial system, and makes recommendations to mitigate those threats and vulnerabilities.  The report was developed collaboratively by Council members and their agencies and staffs.\n\n“This year’s annual report highlights the resilience of the financial system in the face of significant headwinds over the past year,” Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said.  “The Council will continue to coordinate to address the risks identified in this year’s report so that the financial system remains a source of strength for the U.S. economy.”\n\nThe Council’s recommendations in the annual report include the following:\n\nIn addition, the Council identified certain vulnerabilities related to the nonfinancial corporate credit sector, as well as the commercial and residential real estate sectors.  The Council recommends supervisors and financial institutions continue to monitor credit risks and exposures to these sectors.\n\nThe full report can be viewed here.",
    "Statements & Remarks\nJoint IMFC and Development Committee Statement by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen\nApril 12, 2023\nNotwithstanding a difficult global economic environment, our collective efforts in addressing today’s challenges provide me with a sense of optimism.  More than a year since the invasion, Russia’s war against Ukraine remains the biggest impediment to global economic growth, and we continue to grapple with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, worsening impacts of climate change, and the consequences of fragility, conflict, and violence.  These challenges inflict the highest relative cost on low- and middle-income countries, which are already burdened by heightened debt vulnerabilities.  In such trying times, we rely on the IMF and World Bank to help countries respond to shocks through sound policy advice, technical assistance, and financing.  This is why the multilateral development bank (MDB) evolution agenda is one of my top priorities.  Change at the MDBs, starting with the World Bank, is needed to equip these institutions to respond to the increasing frequency, scope, and complexity of global challenges with sufficient speed and scale.\n\nCollaboration between the World Bank and IMF on Ukraine demonstrates the critical role these institutions play in anchoring the international community’s response to shocks.  The World Bank Group has provided a platform through which the international community, including the United States, has mobilized donor financial support of over $20 billion in emergency financing for the public and private sector in Ukraine.  And, we welcome the IMF moving forward with a $15.6 billion program to bolster economic and financial stability and strengthen structural reforms, including on economic governance and anti-corruption.  The United States stands by the people and the government of Ukraine as they bravely defend their country against Russia’s unjust, unlawful, and immoral war.  We are committed to continuing to provide bilateral and multilateral economic support to Ukraine to keep its government running, and, eventually, to help it rebuild.  We call on the international community to stay resolute in its support for Ukraine, and to increase and accelerate assistance to the country.\n\nIn the United States, our economy remains sound.  In response to recent stresses at a few American depository institutions, the United States took actions to stabilize the U.S. financial system and protect depositors.  The U.S. banking system is far more resilient and has a stronger foundation than before the Global Financial Crisis, and we will continue to take steps so that our financial system remains strong.  We are working with international counterparts, including the IMF and the Financial Stability Board, to monitor disruptions to global financial stability and will work with partners as warranted to prevent spillovers to the global financial system.\n\nHeightened uncertainty in the global economic environment underscores the importance of IMF macroeconomic and financial sector surveillance, policy advice, and capacity building—activities at the heart of the IMF’s core mandate.  We will look to the IMF to provide timely economic advice, as countries calibrate difficult policy choices and tradeoffs, and as they contend with elevated inflation, tighter financial conditions, and fiscal pressures.  It is also critical that the Fund execute on its core mandate with regard to assessing external imbalances and exchange rate practices.\n\nNo issue better illustrates the central role played by the IMF in responding to global challenges than addressing debt vulnerabilities in low-income and middle-income countries.  Heightened debt vulnerabilities reinforce the urgent necessity of all bilateral creditors in taking tangible actions to support debt sustainability.  To do so, we must complete the long overdue sovereign debt restructuring for Zambia and quickly provide financing assurances to Ghana.  I welcome the provision of financing assurances for Sri Lanka that allowed the IMF program to move forward, and I urge all creditors to now complete the process of debt restructuring by the first review.  I remain concerned that the Common Framework is taking too long to provide debt relief to low-income countries, and that we lack a robust process for international coordination of debt relief for middle-income countries.\n\nI call on the IMF, with appropriate support from the World Bank, to advance ongoing work to enhance debt transparency, develop guidelines on the use of collateralized debt, assist countries in improving debt management, promote more timely information-sharing of debt sustainability analyses, and develop process improvements to the Common Framework and debt restructuring for low- and middle-income countries.  I encourage the World Bank to continue to support countries in debt distress or with high risk of debt distress through its Sustainable Development Finance Policy.  I look forward to the meeting of the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable this week to make progress on these issues.  The long established and respected principle of preferred creditor status is critical to the MDBs’ ability to provide counter-cyclical support to countries, in highly concessional or grant terms, during times of crisis.  All shareholders must respect this principle.\n\nRecent shocks to the global economy have necessitated a number of important reforms to the IMF’s toolkit, including policies to temporarily raise access limits and enable the IMF to support countries facing exceptionally high uncertainty.  Support for low-income countries in the context of these shocks will be critically important, and I therefore welcome continued efforts to increase resources for the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).  The Biden Administration continues to work with our Congress to lend up to $21 billion to the PRGT and the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST).  I am encouraged by the operationalization of the RST and support continued collaboration with the World Bank on the careful design of macro-critical reforms supported by the RST.  I also welcome the recent review of the IMF’s enhanced governance framework and support measures to strengthen IMF engagement on governance and anti-corruption measures, particularly with regard to the Fund’s emergency financing.  I view the upcoming review on precautionary lending instruments as an important step toward better supporting members facing actual or potential balance of payments difficulties, and an opportunity to better incorporate political risk and governance considerations.\n\nWith regard to IMF resources, I continue to believe that overall resources remain adequate.  At the same time, the IMF needs to follow through on its commitment to a new quota formula that is both fair and simple and primarily reflects the economic size of its member countries.  The IMF should remain a quota-based institution so that it has a consistent, predictable level of resources, which facilitates its role at the center of the global financial safety net.\n\nAs global challenges threaten to reverse past development gains, the need for bold action to address them has only become clearer.  In the last six months, we have made important progress in our efforts to evolve the World Bank Group to better address 21st century threats with a refreshed mission that reflects the need to build resilience in the face of global challenges to achieve our goals to end extreme poverty and build shared prosperity.  I also welcome the efforts to incorporate global challenges into the Country Engagement Model and corporate scorecard.  I strongly support efforts to responsibly stretch the Bank’s balance sheet by lowering the equity to loan ratio and introducing a market hybrid capital pilot that would jointly generate up to $50 billion over the next ten years, as well as starting a process to remove the Statutory Lending Limit.\n\nWe have come a long way since we started this journey six months ago.  And we have more work still to do.  We must build on this important momentum with the World Bank Group preparing an ambitious workplan following the Spring Meetings, taking a staged implementation approach in which reforms are adopted and implemented on a rolling basis through to the Annual Meetings in Marrakesh.  I will leverage key forums like the G7 and the G20 and other key convenings to drive progress at the World Bank and regional development banks.  We look forward to a strong, active role from Ajay Banga to lead the World Bank during this critical moment in its history and thank David Malpass for his service and leadership during the past four years.\n\nAs we look to the IMF and World Bank to better address these challenges, it is imperative that this work continue to support low-income countries.  Low-income countries continue to face strains resulting from rising global food insecurity driven by climate change, conflict, and COVID-19-related economic disruptions that have been only exacerbated by Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine.  We welcome the IFIs scaling their efforts to address food security through the Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity, alongside the IMF’s Food Shock Window, which complement the United States’ own leading role in committing more than $13 billion since the outbreak of Russia’s war to address humanitarian and longer-term food security needs.  The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, an important part of this food security architecture, recently allocated $220 million in agricultural investment grants for projects in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia.\n\nProtecting the resources that go to these countries, including through the International Development Association (IDA), is a critical priority for the United States.  Judicious stewardship of its existing resources must be prioritized if IDA is to be well-equipped in its capacity to address current and future challenges.  IDA Management and donors should explore further measures to responsibly add to IDA’s capacity over the short and medium term, while recognizing the constraints on both IDA countries and donors. \n \nSimilarly, we must sustain our achievements to improve health security and response, especially the Pandemic Fund, which launched last year and issued its first call for proposals last month.  We must continue the important work on finance-health collaboration in the G20 with the IFIs to be better prepared for future, cross-border health threats.\n\nTo enhance our resilience to shocks and smooth the economic transition to a net-zero global economy, we must build on our efforts to address climate change adaptation and mitigation.  If we do not take strong action this decade to meet our climate goals, climate-vulnerable countries like those in the Caribbean and Pacific Islands, low-lying states, as well as a growing number of vulnerable middle-income countries, will face existential risks, as will the global economy.  This is why we must continue to mainstream climate science into economic policy.  The United States is doing its part.  We are committed to meeting our climate goals using tools such as the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  These measures are working to shift the U.S. economy along the energy transition and toward President Biden’s goal to reduce emissions 50-52 percent by 2030.  These laws, when paired with sustainable infrastructure investment in new climate-forward technologies, will promote equitable growth, the delivery of basic services, wellbeing, and resilience.  Our investments in climate-forward technologies will also bring down global prices, which will have a positive impact for all countries to meet their global climate goals.\n\nThe IFIs are key partners in the effort by national governments to address climate change, and we look forward to the public release of the Joint MDB Approach on Paris Alignment.  I welcome the World Bank Group’s work on climate, particularly climate adaptation and resilience, highlighting that helping the most vulnerable prepare for, and recover from, natural disasters is a priority.  I also welcome the World Bank’s successful launch of the Country Climate and Development Reports, which provides an avenue for collaboration with the IMF’s RST as well as other parts of the IFI system.  Climate diagnostics such as these underscore the importance of consultation as the IFIs align financial flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement and close coordination between the IMF and World Bank on climate issues.  We reaffirm the important role of the World Bank Group as a lead financier, convenor, and source of knowledge on climate change.\n\nThe Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, including the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs), strive to increase investment in infrastructure sectors critical to equitable growth and support countries’ clean energy and digital transitions.  These targeted initiatives have the potential for significant impact in supporting countries to achieve their climate goals, shore up sustainable infrastructure stock, and boost productivity and economic growth.  If we are to make transformative gains towards global climate goals, public sector investment must be paired with and help mobilize private sector investment.  I call on the World Bank Group to step up its support for quality infrastructure and the energy transition, including by engaging actively in the JETPs.\n\nFor the IMF and World Bank to deliver on all these priorities, we call for maintaining focus on governance and accountability within these institutions.  The IMF’s implementation of its Institutional Safeguards Review will be critical to bolstering the Fund’s dispute resolution processes and bolstering staff’s voice.  In addition, diversity and inclusion at the IMF and the World Bank remain vital to these institutions’ effectiveness and sustainability.  Diversity is equally as important for the Executive Boards, and I call for greater action on promoting diversity in representation on both Boards, including through greater use of targets to help address weak gender diversity at the IMF Executive Board.\n\nI thank staff and management of both institutions for their tireless work at a time when expectations and needs are high.",
    "Press Releases\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Financial Stability Oversight Council Meeting\nApril 21, 2023\nAs Prepared for Delivery\n\nOur first agenda item is a discussion and votes on two proposals. The first is the Council’s proposed framework for financial stability risk identification, assessment, and response. The second is the proposed interpretive guidance on nonbank financial company designations. \n\nBefore we turn to the presentation, let me first speak about how the recent banking developments demonstrate the importance of the actions we are about to take.\n\nLast month, the government took necessary actions to decisively manage the fallout from the failure of two regional banking institutions. Our goal was to mitigate the serious risk of contagion and protect the broader banking system and economy. The situation has stabilized in the past few weeks. And our banking system remains sound, with strong capital and liquidity positions. Of course, we continue to be vigilant and monitor conditions closely.\n\nStill, these developments have reminded many of the fear and uncertainty that can accompany financial disruptions. For all in this room, I am certain that the developments underscored the importance of our work on financial stability: to continue to improve the resilience of a financial system that can support the economy through both good and bad times. \n\nLast month’s events show us that our work is not yet done. The authority for emergency interventions is critical. But equally as important is a supervisory and regulatory regime that can help prevent financial disruptions from starting and spreading in the first place.\n\nI believe that the votes we will take today advance that very mission. \n\nWe will first vote to issue, for public comment, a proposed analytic framework on financial stability. This framework provides new public transparency into how the Council does its work: how it identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks to financial stability. It’s the first time the Council has published such a document. This framework outlines common vulnerabilities and transmission channels through which shocks can propagate through the financial system. And it lays out how the Council considers the tools it will use to address these risks.\n\nThe framework emphasizes the importance of taking a comprehensive and rigorous approach. Addressing the diverse range of financial vulnerabilities that exist today – and that may arise tomorrow – requires a broad set of flexible tools. Importantly, the Council does not broadly prioritize one type of tool over another. Rather, we plainly examine a risk – and design our response to address the risk we are seeking to mitigate. \n\nOften, the Council will determine that a risk should be addressed by existing regulators – using what is sometimes called an activities-based approach. These may be instances where systemic risks emanate from widely conducted activities in a particular sector or market. FSOC has made activities-based recommendations in traditional areas like money market and open-end funds – as well as in newer areas like crypto-assets. Many of these risks and recommendations are described every year in the Council’s annual reports. But there may be certain instances when systemic risks could emanate from a particular entity – one that might not be within the jurisdiction of a regulator with adequate prudential or supervisory authorities. In that case, an entity-focused approach may be more appropriate.\n\nThat’s exactly why Congress gave the Council the authority to designate nonbank financial companies for Federal Reserve Board supervision and enhanced prudential standards. And it’s why the Council is also voting today to issue proposed guidance that would enable us to use that tool effectively – should it be needed.\n\nWe are proposing revisions to certain elements of the Council’s existing guidance that have made it difficult to use its nonbank designation authority. The existing guidance – issued in 2019 – created inappropriate hurdles as part of the designation process. These additional steps are not legally required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Nor are they useful or feasible. Some are based on a flawed view of how financial crises begin and the costs that they impose. It has been estimated that a designation process with these steps could take six years to complete. That is an unrealistic timeline that could prevent the Council from acting to address an emerging risk to financial stability before it’s too late.\n\nThe designation tool serves as an important part of our post-Global Financial Crisis defense. It is an important preventative tool to address systemic risks that may arise from a nonbank financial firm whose activities or distress could threaten the financial system. We are acting today to restore the effectiveness of this authority.\n\nAs we do, we are also taking significant steps to ensure that the Council’s nonbank designation process is rigorous and transparent. The proposed guidance provides for strong procedural protections. This includes significant engagement and communication with companies under review – minimizing administrative burdens on these companies while providing ample opportunities to be heard. The Council will also engage with the company’s primary regulator during any designation review. And through the separate proposed analytic framework, we are providing the public with more information about how nonbank designation fits into the Council’s broader approach to financial stability risk monitoring and mitigation.\n\nIn all, I believe that our votes today are a major step toward strengthening our safeguards for the U.S. financial system. We look forward to public comments on these proposals.\n\nLet me now turn to Sandra Lee, Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Council. She will provide an overview of these proposals.\n\n###",
    "Secretary Statements & Remarks\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at High Level Panel at Summit for a New Global Financing Pact\nJune 23, 2023\nAs Prepared for Delivery\n\nThank you, President Macron.  And good morning, everyone.  It is great to be with you today to discuss the important question of how we align our efforts to reduce poverty with our efforts to combat climate change and other global challenges.\n\nIt is clear from this Summit that we all share the goal of securing a more prosperous, healthy, and livable planet.  It is also clear that there is political will and commitment to multilateralism to translate intentions into action.\n\nIndeed, I am pleased to share this stage with colleagues from around the world, including Premier Li Qiang. As I said in a speech earlier in the year, as the world’s two largest economies, we also have a responsibility to work together on global issues. It is something the world expects of us.\n\nLast fall, we launched an initiative to evolve the multilateral development banks – or MDBs – to better address global challenges like climate change, pandemics, fragility and conflict.  During this process, we have sometimes heard concerns about a tradeoff between addressing these challenges and accelerating investments in health, education or poverty alleviation.\n\nIndeed, some wonder how the MDBs can do more of one without doing less of the other – given their limited resources and capacity.\n\nBut I strongly believe that is a false choice.  The MDBs must do both – and do both well.  That’s because countries cannot make sustained progress on poverty eradication and the sustainable development goals if they do not invest in building resilience to these global shocks. If one thing is certain in our world, it is that these shocks will come.\n\nIndeed, global challenges are increasing in scope and complexity.  They disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable, and they are intimately intertwined with national challenges.\n\nThese are not hypothetical concerns.  We see the consequences playing out in very real ways for people around the world:\n\nClimate change is dampening agricultural yields and driving food insecurity in many parts of the world.  I saw this on full display when I visited three African countries earlier this year.\n\nIndeed, the smallholder farmers I visited in Zambia described the toll that extreme weather events and floods are taking on their livelihoods. They made no distinction between these global challenges and national challenges.\n\nIn addition, threats to global health disrupt entire societies and economies, with the pandemic leading to the first global increase in extreme poverty in decades.\n\nAnd, conflict not only causes immense human suffering, but also stunts economic growth and contributes to the significant displacement of people across regions.\n\nThese problems are not contained within national borders nor can they be solved by countries acting alone.\n\nThese are fundamentally global problems that are seriously hampering the ability of countries to grow, generate jobs, and reduce extreme poverty.\n\nThat is why it is imperative that we evolve the MDBs to respond to global challenges with sufficient speed and scale.  Doing any less is a disservice to the rest of the development agenda.\n\nThe World Bank is in the midst of accelerating progress on the evolution agenda. President Banga has spoken at length about this effort.\n\nWe already have tangible, concrete results – thanks to our MDB evolution initiative\n\nThe World Bank has updated its mission to account for the fact that addressing global challenges is critical to achieving the Twin Goals of eradicating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.\n\nIn addition, the World Bank is integrating global challenges into its diagnostic work, country engagement, and corporate scorecard, which will help engrain work to address these challenges into the institution’s DNA.\n\nAnd, the Bank is responsibly stretching its balance sheet and pursuing innovative measures to unlock up to $50 billion in additional lending capacity over the next ten years.\n\nAs part of our agenda, we believe that MDBs could, as a system, unlock $200 billion in new lending capacity over the same timeframe through balance sheet measures that are either already under implementation or being deliberated.\n\nWe began the evolution initiative at the World Bank.  But we have always recognized that maximizing its impact requires an evolution across the MDB system, and even beyond to cover the funds.\n\nThe MDBs are vital multilateral tools to help us face the demands of our changing world.  Yet they would be even more effective if they were to work better together as a system, each operating with its relative strengths and expertise, and in concert with others and also in better partnership with the private sector, philanthropies and civil society.\n\nWe have the necessary ingredients to make real progress – political leadership, creativity, innovative financing mechanisms, and the openness and courage to learn from the past as well as to forge new solutions for the future.  With strong collective action across all shareholders, management, and other critical partners like the African Union, we can help meet the aspirations of people around the world.\n\nThank you.",
    "Secretary Statements & Remarks\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at Meeting with Premier Li Qiang of the People’s Republic of China\nJuly 7, 2023\nAs Prepared for Delivery\n\nPremier Li, I am pleased to see you again following the Paris Summit.\n\nLast November, President Biden and President Xi met in Bali for their first in-person presidential meeting. They emphasized that senior officials from our countries should deepen constructive efforts on macroeconomic stability and address shared global challenges.\n\nI am in Beijing to build on that direction. I recently delivered a speech that laid out the Administration’s economic approach towards China. We seek healthy economic competition that is not winner-take-all but that, with a fair set of rules, can benefit both countries over time.\n\nThere are also important global challenges where the United States and China have a duty both to our own countries and to the world to cooperate and show leadership.\n\nThe United States will, in certain circumstances, need to pursue targeted actions to protect its national security. And we may disagree in these instances.\n\nHowever, we should not allow any disagreement to lead to misunderstandings that unnecessarily worsen our bilateral economic and financial relationship.\n\nI agree with what you said in your speech at the World Economic Forum that “differences should not be a cause for estrangement, but a driver for more communication and exchange.”\n\nIt is my hope that this visit can spur more regular channels of communication between our two countries.I look forward to our discussion.\n\n###",

    "Statements & Remarks\nG7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ Communiqué\nMay 25, 2024\nWe, the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, met on 23-25 May 2024 in Stresa, Italy. We were honoured to be joined by the Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko. The Heads of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank Group (WBG), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Financial Stability Board (FSB) also took part in the meeting.\n\nWe also held an outreach session with Brazil, Mauritania (representing the African Union), the Republic of Korea, and Saudi Arabia. Over the course of this session, we exchanged views on the global implications of Artificial Intelligence, ongoing initiatives for development and cross-border payments, and agreed to continue working in close cooperation in relevant multilateral fora, such as the G20. As the international community faces multiple challenges that require a coordinated response, we renewed our commitment to multilateral cooperation to foster sustainable development. Our discussions were informed by valuable contributions from the Heads of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures’ (CPMI) Secretariat and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\n1. The global economy has shown greater resilience than expected against multiple shocks including the COVID19 pandemic, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and the associated inflationary pressures. Labour markets remain relatively robust, and inflation has continued to moderate, although core inflation is showing some persistence, notably in the service sector. However, global economic growth is likely to remain below its historical average and heterogeneous across countries and regions. The economic outlook remains subject to risks amid the threat of escalating geopolitical tensions and volatile energy prices. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and the critical situation in the Middle East could further disrupt international trade flows, the smooth functioning of supply chains, and living conditions.\n\n2. Over the past four years, fiscal and monetary policies have mitigated the macroeconomic impact of the COVID19 pandemic and of the negative spillovers caused by Russia’s war against Ukraine. Our policy efforts will continue to focus on innovation and the promotion of just green and digital transitions, as well as other key policy priorities. Catalysing investments towards the green and digital transitions will also support productivity growth. Gradually rebuilding fiscal buffers is a key priority to strengthen fiscal sustainability and create more space to respond to new shocks, while continuing to protect the most vulnerable and making needed investment to promote sustainability and resilience, complemented by an ambitious structural reform agenda to enhance growth potential. Price and financial stability are a pre-requisite for sustainable and balanced growth. Central banks remain strongly committed to achieving price stability in line with their respective mandates and will continue to calibrate their policies in a data-dependent manner. We reaffirm our May 2017 exchange rate commitments. We reiterate our commitment to sound and well-communicated macroeconomic and structural policies, while endeavouring to limit negative spillovers through clear communication.\n\n3. We also reiterate our strong commitment to a free, fair, and rules-based multilateral system. Building on the legacy of the Japanese G7 Presidency, we will advance our cooperation to enhance global economic resilience and economic security and protect our economies from systemic shocks and vulnerabilities. To this end, we will work to make our supply chains more resilient, reliable, diversified, and sustainable, and to respond to harmful practices, while safeguarding critical and emerging technologies. We will consider, when necessary, appropriate measures to promote de-risking and diversification of supply with partners within and beyond the G7. We will enhance cooperation to address non-market policies and practices and distortive policies including those leading to overcapacity through a wide range of policy tools and rules to ensure a global level playing field. While reaffirming our interest in a balanced and reciprocal collaboration, we express concerns about China’s comprehensive use of non-market policies and practices that undermines our workers, industries, and economic resilience. We will continue to monitor the potential negative impacts of overcapacity and will consider taking steps to ensure a level playing field, in line with World Trade Organization (WTO) principles. In addition, we encourage efforts from relevant International Organizations (IOs) to improve the quality and availability of data on industrial policy and non-market practices as well as monitoring tools in this area. We support work, in collaboration with other relevant tracks, to assess the macroeconomic impact of subsidies and other industrial and trade policy measures globally, based on comparable information; and to promote a dialogue with third countries on issues related to industrial policies, economic fragmentation, market concentration risks and overcapacity.\n\n4. To achieve these goals, we will enhance cooperation with the aim of advancing a G7 dialogue between relevant ministries regarding global trends, policy responses and their implications. Where appropriate and relevant, we will engage partners beyond the G7, in addition to IMF, WBG, WTO, and OECD.\n\n5. More than two years since Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s war of aggression continues to cause immense human and economic losses in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, as well as negative spillover effects on the global economy, including through elevated energy and food prices. We stand united in condemning once again Russia’s war of aggression, and in calling on Russia to immediately end it. This will benefit Ukraine and the international community at large. We also condemn in the strongest terms Hamas’ brutal terrorist attack against Israel on 7 October 2023. We are deeply concerned about the devastating and growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Stressing that urgent action is needed, we will continue to cooperate in delivering vital humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in need and to provide support for civilians and economies in the region that are adversely impacted by the conflict and its spillover effects. Noting the humanitarian and economic risks posed by a regional escalation, including through disruptions to international shipping, we reiterate our call for stability in the broader region. Maintaining economic stability in the West Bank is also critical for regional security. We call on Israel to take the necessary measures to ensure that correspondent banking services between Israeli and Palestinian banks remain in place, so that vital financial transactions and critical trade and services continue; to release withheld clearance revenues to the Palestinian Authority, in view of its urgent fiscal needs; and to remove or relax other measures that have negatively impacted commerce to avoid further exacerbating the economic situation in the West Bank.\n\n6. We salute once more the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people and reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes. We remain strongly committed to helping Ukraine meet its urgent short-term financing needs, as well as coordinating its long-term recovery and reconstruction priorities (currently estimated by the WBG at almost USD 486 billion over 10 years), including within the Multi-Agency Donor Coordination Platform. In this context, we strongly welcome the approval by the United States of the Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, which includes USD 61 billion in economic and military support to respond to Russia’s war against Ukraine. We also welcome the disbursement to date of EUR 6 billion of bridge financing to Ukraine under the EUR 50 billion EU Ukraine Facility, as well as the recent EU approval of the “Ukraine Plan”, which will be the basis for regular assistance to Ukraine under the Facility and will mobilise public and private investments for its urgent economic recovery and reconstruction, also in view to Ukraine’s future accession to the EU. In addition, we welcome the announcement by the United Kingdom of support for Ukraine totalling GBP 3 billion per year until 2030, or for as long as it takes; Japan’s approval of additional USD 2 billion budget support for 2024; and the additional CAD 4.2 billion in military, development and financial aid recently announced by Canada. Building on the positive completion of the first three reviews of the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Program for Ukraine, and on the enduring commitment of the Ukrainian authorities to reform under challenging circumstances, we look forward to a successful completion of the fourth EFF review in June. We also support Ukraine’s efforts to reach a timely debt-treatment agreement with its private creditors, in line with its IMF Program. We look forward to the Ukraine Recovery Conferences, to be hosted in Berlin in 2024 and in Rome in 2025.\n\n7. Our financial and broader economic sanctions are already having a clear impact in restricting Russia’s ability to fund and support its illegal invasion of Ukraine. We remain committed to tightening compliance with and enforcement of the Oil Price Cap while maintaining the stability of global energy markets. We will respond robustly to price cap violations, including by sanctioning those engaged in deceptive practices while transporting Russian oil and taking action against the networks Russia has developed to extract additional revenues from evasion. We are also committed to further financial and economic sanctions to reduce Russia’s sources of revenue and capacity to wage war against Ukraine, including continuing to target Russia’s energy revenue and future extractive capabilities. We will counter attempts to evade or circumvent sanctions, including through facilitation of Russia’s defence industry procurement efforts by financial institutions. Financial institutions and other entities that facilitate Russia’s acquisition of items or equipment for its defence industrial base are supporting actions that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine. Where appropriate, we stand ready to impose sanctions on individuals and entities that help Russia acquire advanced materials, technology, and equipment for its military industrial base. We are also re-doubling our domestic efforts to make sure that companies and financial institutions in G7 countries are not party to Russia’s circumvention schemes. We strongly condemn the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, in direct violation of relevant UNSCRs. We call upon Iran to stop assisting the Russian military and its war on Ukraine. We express our concern about transfers to Russia from firms around the world, including those in China, of dual-use materials and components for weapons and equipment for military production.\n\n8. We welcome the EU decision to direct extraordinary profits stemming from immobilised Russian sovereign assets for the benefit of Ukraine. Following up on the G7 Leaders’ Statement of 24 February 2024, we are making progress in our discussions on potential avenues to bring forward the extraordinary profits stemming from immobilized Russian sovereign assets to the benefit of Ukraine, consistent with international law and our respective legal systems, with a view to presenting options to provide additional financial support to Ukraine to our Leaders ahead of the Apulia Summit in June. We reaffirm that, consistent with our respective legal systems, Russia’s sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.\n\n9. Given a range of risks to the global outlook, we reiterate that a continued focus on financial stability and regulatory issues remains vital to ensure the effective functioning of the financial system. We underline the importance of work carried out by the FSB and the Standard-Setting Bodies (SSBs) to identify and monitor vulnerabilities in the financial system and develop policies to address them.\n\n10. We strongly support the FSB’s ongoing work to enhance the resilience of the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector by addressing vulnerabilities associated with liquidity mismatches, leverage, pro-cyclicality, and interconnectedness. This work is aimed at mitigating potential systemic risks stemming from the NBFI sector which may trigger or amplify adverse shocks, cause contagion, and eventually jeopardise its ability to provide sustainable financing to the economy. We welcome the recent publication of the FSB Revised Policy Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Liquidity Mismatch in Open-Ended Funds (OEFs). The recommendations aim to strengthen liquidity management by OEF managers by providing greater clarity on the redemption terms they can offer to investors based on the liquidity of their asset holdings, and to achieve greater and more consistent use of liquidity management tools (LMTs). We commit to implementing such recommendations, together with International Organization of Securities Commissions’ guidance on anti-dilution LMTs. We also welcome the FSB Thematic Review on Money Market Fund (MMF) Reforms. We reiterate the need to adopt policies, if not already done so, in line with the agreed FSB framework and toolkit to ensure resilience of MMF. We look forward to the finalisation of the FSB proposals to strengthen liquidity preparedness for margin and collateral calls and the SSB’s related proposals. We encourage ongoing FSB efforts aimed at improving the information and data available to authorities and market participants for monitoring leverage and calibrating policies to address the related risks.\n\n11. We remain committed to strengthening cyber resilience in the financial sector, also against the background of heightening geopolitical tensions and in the context of hybrid threats. Cyber threats are evolving rapidly and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Emerging technologies, like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum computing, provide new opportunities but also pose new challenges that are not yet fully understood. Besides regulation and supervision, it is crucial to promote sound cooperation and information sharing among relevant public and private stakeholders. Adoption of guidelines, deeper analysis of emerging risks, and cyber exercises are important building blocks of an effective strategy and should also inform the international coordination of responses and sharing of key information. In this respect, we welcome the successful completion of the cross-border coordination exercise that the G7 Cyber Expert Group (G7 CEG) conducted on 16 and 17 April 2024, and we ask the G7 CEG to further advance its work to improve the financial sector's preparedness and response capacity to cyber threats.\n\n12. As G7 Members, we welcome initiatives to take forward the G20 Roadmap to enhance cross-border payments that aim to contribute to faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive cross-border payments, while maintaining their safety, resilience, and financial integrity. Improving cross-border payments should benefit both advanced economies and emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), contribute to financial integration, and counter the risk of market fragmentation. A variety of technological solutions to improve payment system infrastructure and arrangements are emerging that differ in terms of technical and design features, and in the degree of involvement of the public and private sectors. The G7 supports responsible innovation that enables interoperability among new and existing cross-border payment systems. We emphasise that such solutions should embed widely shared values of the International Monetary and Financial System, including appropriate transparency, the rule of law and sound economic governance. They should also support a level playing field for private sector competition and innovation, and the observance of relevant international standards, such as the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures and FATF Standards on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Hence, we look forward to further discussions to explore and promote such solutions and aim to support technical assistance and capacity building for the development of fast payment systems, while making progress towards connecting them, as appropriate, as they continue to develop and gain momentum. We also reaffirm our support for international cooperation within the G7 and beyond, in particular with EMDEs through the G20 Roadmap. In this context, we strongly support ongoing work by the CPMI, including a report on governance and oversight of fast payment systems interlinking arrangements, and look forward to the FSB recommendations to reduce frictions resulting from differences in frameworks for data related to cross-border payments, which will be critical to meet the quantitative targets under the G20 Roadmap.\n\n13. The safety, efficiency and integrity of payment system are key foundations. In light of increasing demand from EMDEs for policy guidance and capacity development, we welcome the IMF’s work on the “CBDC Handbook” which will help EMDEs consider the potential risks, costs, and benefits of CBDCs in the context of other payment innovations. We encourage the IMF to continue to develop and update the chapters of the handbook to incorporate the latest findings.\n\n14. We reiterate the importance of stepping up global efforts to combat money-laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing, as well as our commitment to supporting the FATF and its Regional Bodies in overseeing the implementation of the FATF standards across the global network, including in the next round of mutual evaluations. We also support the FATF's initiatives on accelerating global implementation of its standards on virtual assets, including the recent publication of the implementation status table, and its work on emerging risks, including from DeFi arrangements and peer-to-peer transactions. We reaffirm our support for the G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets and our commitment to implement effective regulatory and supervisory frameworks consistent with the FSB’s recommendations and standards and guidance established by SSBs. In addition, we commit to the timely and effective implementation of the revised FATF standards on the transparency of beneficial ownership of legal persons and legal arrangements and on asset recovery. We also support the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion in its work for advancing financial inclusion of individuals and Micro-, Small-, and Medium- Enterprises (MSMEs).\n\n15. We recognize the potentially transformative role of AI for our economies and societies. AI offers novel opportunities for productivity growth, but it also brings new risks and policy challenges, notably for the labour market and financial stability for example the potential for herd behaviour and an increase in the frequency of exogenous financial shocks. We will advance our discussion on AI's economic potential, and on how to leverage AI to increase productivity and growth while supporting a human-centred approach and enhancing well-being. AI also offers new opportunities to improve the quality of public services, the efficiency of the public administration, and the effectiveness and fairness of tax collection. We will share experiences among finance ministries and central banks to forge a common G7 view on how to leverage the potential of AI while closely monitoring and mitigating adverse effects and risks. We will continue work to deepen our understanding of how AI affects the economy and the financial sector and how to ensure that our institutions are equipped to deal with AI, with a focus on the following shared policy agenda: macroeconomic impact and scenarios, measurement challenges, impact on fiscal policy and on financial stability, implications on the required skills of the labour force, and environmental sustainability.\n\n16. Furthermore, we recognize that AI offers significant opportunities for social and economic progress, including in developing countries, in crucial sectors like health, education, and agriculture. However, we also recognize that there is a risk of further divergence among countries if competition, distributional and displacement effects are not properly addressed and, in particular, if enabling conditions are not in place. We are committed to continue these discussions and we invite International Financial Institutions to keep working on these issues, within their mandates, to assess the macroeconomic implications of AI adoption and to help developing countries take advantage of the opportunities of AI while mitigating risks.\n\n17. We reaffirm our strong commitment to strengthening the governance and finance of the global health architecture (GHA). In this regard, we welcome the ambitious plan and renewed focus of the World Bank on achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in line with the targets of the UN 2030 Agenda, by improving affordability, expanding its geographic reach, and increasing the scope of services, as well as the recent announcement to establish the UHC Knowledge Hub. We strongly encourage cross-collaboration and harmonization of efforts with other Global Health Initiatives (GHIs), including a focus on pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response (PPR) and on strengthening domestic health systems. With reference to the upcoming refinancing processes of several GHIs, such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, we call on the donor community to coordinate efforts and increase investments, in line with their capacities, in order to ensure sustainable funding and maximize the impact of available resources. We reiterate our support to the Pandemic Fund and encourage the expansion of its donor base, as well as further contributions.\n\n18. We welcome progress made on response financing since last year’s G7 Shared Understanding on Enhanced Finance-Health Coordination and pandemic PPR Financing, including the development of new financing instruments to enhance coordination and allow for a quick and efficient deployment of funds, such as Gavi’s Day Zero Pandemic Financing Facility, and the WBG’s focus on pandemic preparedness as part of the evolution agenda, including an expanded Crisis Preparedness and Response Toolkit. We remain committed to continue exploring innovative mechanisms for response financing to address remaining functional gaps, in close coordination with the G20 Joint Finance-Health Task Force (JFHTF). We also welcome the collaboration efforts of the participating G7 Development Financial Institutions, along with the European Investment Bank and the International Finance Corporation, in establishing a Partnership Framework to effectively provide surge financing for procurement, production, and delivery of safe, effective, quality and affordable medical countermeasures (MCMs) in low- and middle-income countries. We encourage further work to ensure all these initiatives can collectively support the procurement of MCMs for multiple countries.\n\n19. Acknowledging that the coordination framework between the IMF, the World Bank and the WHO is close to finalization, we call for the conclusion of the process and the prompt operationalization of the pandemic preparedness component of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST). We will also continue discussing instruments to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at domestic and global level, and to promote research, including into new antimicrobials as well as alternatives to their use, through push and pull incentives, taking into consideration the outcomes of the UNGA High Level Meeting on AMR this September.\n\n20. We reiterate our commitment to paving the way for the global transition toward a net-zero economy and to implementing effective policy frameworks to mobilise the substantial public and private investment that will be necessary to achieve that goal. We recognise the importance of international cooperation to minimise any negative spillover effects from asymmetric policies. We agree that countries’ policy mix for a just transition should be designed in a way that encourages innovation, finance and investment in green technologies, reflects equity considerations, and promotes social and political support for climate action.\n\n21. With these objectives in mind, we welcome a Finance Track Menu of Policy Options for a Just Transition towards Net Zero, developed by the Finance track, also based on the analytical support of the IMF, the WBG and the OECD, which focuses on five key aspects: (i) the impact of climate policies and green investment on growth, productivity and innovation; (ii) exploring carbon pricing potential, amongst other policy options, in pursuing long-term decarbonisation while dealing with the costs of transition in the short run; (iii) the distributional impact of climate policies, (iv) ways to foster the legitimacy and political acceptability of climate action, and (v) fostering international cooperation, including by improving the assessment and measurement of carbon leakage risks, and on ways to mitigate them. We also reiterate our support for the OECD’s Inclusive Forum on Carbon Mitigation Approaches work in promoting international cooperation on carbon intensity measurement.\n\n22. We underline the benefits of enhancing the availability, comparability and credibility of robust and science-based, transition-related information, including from greater consistency and transparency of transition plans both in the financial sector and the real economy, and forward-looking metrics that can provide information on credible transition pathways for both the public and private sectors. We welcome the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards for reporting on sustainability and for climate-related disclosures and underline the importance of working towards globally interoperable sustainability disclosure frameworks.\n\n23. G7 central banks, taking advantage of the network of modelling experts, in cooperation with the Network for Greening the Financial System and other international organizations, will continue to increase the understanding of the macro-financial implications of climate change and the transition to net-zero, as relevant to their specific mandates, including impacts on inflation and economic activity both in the short and long term, as well as their cross-border consequences and potential spillover effects.\n\n24. Climate change is testing the resilience of our economic and financial systems, through more frequent, severe, and unpredictable natural hazards. Narrowing the natural catastrophe insurance protection gap requires a collaborative effort between multiple parties, including governmental actors at all levels, regulators, insurance supervisors, insurers, and re-insurers, in a wide range of areas including incentivising risk reduction and prevention and improving risk awareness and financial literacy. Among viable measures to increase insurance coverage, multi-stakeholder collaboration could take the form of public-private natural catastrophe insurance schemes involving relevant information and data sharing, risk-sharing as well as public and private financing. To support policymakers, regulators and insurance supervisors when considering the development of such programmes, we welcome a High-Level Framework for Public-Private Insurance Programmes against Natural Hazards, developed by the Finance track with the OECD and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. We also stress the importance of promoting regional disaster risk finance initiatives, including with a focus on the specific needs of vulnerable countries and emerging markets.\n\n25. We reiterate our strong political commitment to establish a more stable and fairer international tax system fit for the 21st century. The implementation of the Two-Pillar Solution is our top priority, and we remain committed to finalising the work within the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework with a view to signing the Multilateral Convention on Pillar One by the end of June 2024. We call on all members of the Inclusive Framework to make every effort toward this goal.\n\n26. We welcome that an increasing number of jurisdictions have implemented or started the implementation of Pillar Two in their domestic legislation and support ongoing work to ensure consistent implementation. We look forward to the signing ceremony of the Multilateral Instrument for the implementation of the Subject-to-Tax-Rule later this year.\n\n27. We welcome progress made on tax transparency and support the effective implementation of the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework by the relevant jurisdictions, with the aim of commencing first exchanges by 2027 or 2028 at the latest. We welcome the OECD “2024 Progress Report on Tax Co-operation for the 21st Century” and look forward to possible ways to further enhance the administrative co-operation and continue exchange of information for tax purposes.\n\n28. Noting the discussions emerging in several fora, we remain committed to fostering international cooperation on tax issues, building on the existing achievements, with a broad participation of developing and developed countries. We will continue to work constructively with the Brazilian G20 Presidency to advance international tax co-operation. We will work to increase our efforts aimed at progressive and fair taxation of individuals.\n\n29. With regard to the discussions at the UN Ad Hoc Committee to Draft Terms of Reference for a United Nations Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, we reiterate the importance of (i) consensus-based decisions to support a stable and predictable international tax system and promote an inclusive and effective international tax cooperation, (ii) prioritizing issues more likely to achieve consensus, and (iii) focusing on enhancing domestic resource mobilisation and capacity building in tax matters for countries in need.\n\n30. We reiterate our firm commitment to evolve and strengthen MDBs to address the most pressing development and global challenges. We welcome further G20 discussions in line with our G20 Leaders’ commitment to achieve better, bigger, and more effective MDBs, and we consider the evolution agenda as a key component of these discussions.\n\n31. On the better and more effective dimensions, we encourage MDBs to work better as a system, to leverage their respective comparative advantages and to coordinate better to maximize impact, including through country platforms. We also call on MDBs to advance implementation of the G20 Recommendations on the use of policy-based lending calibrated for concrete and measurable impact, including by coordinating the design and implementation of policy, institutional, and regulatory reforms, particularly to remove constraints on private investment. In addition, we urge MDBs to step up their efforts to mobilize private capital, including through setting ambitious mobilization targets, aligning staff incentives, and transparent reporting, and to enhance domestic resource mobilization.\n\n32. On bigger MDBs, we welcome that the G20 MDBs Capital Adequacy Framework (CAF) Review has already secured over USD 200 billion of prospective additional financing for the next ten years, and we look forward to further CAF implementation to unlock additional significant financing. In addition, we underscore the critical role the CAF Review has played and will continue to play in the increase of lending capacities of MDBs, and the design of innovative instruments such as hybrid capital and portfolio guarantees, for which the G7 and other donors have already demonstrated their support. Once approved domestically, the commitments of the G7 countries to these instruments will make it possible to further expand IBRD lending by around USD 68 billion over the next ten years. We also commend the AfDB for its successful first issuance of hybrid capital to market investors. We call for a continuing and ambitious implementation of CAF and look forward to even more responsible stretching of balance sheets and pursuit of innovative measures, while safeguarding MDBs’ long-term financial sustainability, excellent credit ratings, and preferred creditor status along with the MDBs jointly exploring ways to better reflect the value of callable capital in their capital adequacy methodologies, including through further discussions with credit rating agencies. We recognize that G20 CAF implementation would maximize the leverage effect of any future capital injections, and we consider the Board of each MDB to be best placed to determine if and when a capital increase is needed, in addition to CAF measures, to address global and development challenges. MDBs boards and management could also consider establishing a process to assess the alignment of their resources with shareholders’ strategic objectives at regular intervals.\n\n33. We welcome the general capital increases and related policy commitments at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Inter-American Development Bank Invest (IDB Invest) and look forward to the general callable capital increase at the AfDB.\n\n34. We reaffirm the importance of continuing to provide significant concessional support to low-income countries. We call on the MDBs to better address fragility, conflict, and violence by investing in prevention, remaining engaged during conflicts, developing the local private sector and local financial markets, enhancing institutional and staff capacity and incentives to address fragility, and leveraging strategic partnerships, including with regional organisations.\n\n35. We welcome the successful replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (AsDF14) and will support a successful International Development Association (IDA21) replenishment built on a strong policy and financing package that delivers ambitious outcomes. We also look forward to fruitful discussions around the Mid-term review of the African Development Fund and commit to work toward a successful replenishment next year (AfDF17). We recognize that contributions from all stakeholders are needed, and we support efforts to broaden the donor base.\n\n36. We also acknowledge calls to review the governance of Global Financial Institutions to strengthen their impact. We highlight recent progress in that direction, and we welcome discussions on appropriate roles and responsibilities across the system.\n\n37. We support the ongoing G20 independent review of International Environmental and Climate Funds and look forward to the ensuing recommendations to streamline their processes and facilitate access to those resources by countries that are most vulnerable to climate change, as well as to increase financial leverage of donors’ resources and the mobilization of private capital, including through working better with MDBs.\n\n38. We stand ready to step up our efforts to address debt challenges in low- and middle-income countries. We look forward to the G20 improving the implementation of the Common Framework for debt treatments in a predictable, timely, orderly, and coordinated manner, providing more clarity to debtors and creditors and building on lessons learned. We look forward to the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by official creditors for Zambia, and to final arrangements between Zambia and all private creditors. We look forward to the conclusion of the MoU agreement for Ghana and encourage the finalization of an IMF staff-level agreement for Ethiopia. Beyond the Common Framework, we welcome the advanced work towards the finalization of the MoU on debt treatment for Sri Lanka by the Official Creditor Committee. Building on the Sri Lanka case, debt vulnerabilities in middle-income countries should be addressed by enhancing multilateral coordination. We underline the importance of information sharing in debt restructurings, and we call on all stakeholders to improve debt data accuracy and transparency to secure credible and effective assessments and call on all major creditor’s participation in data-sharing exercises. We encourage efforts to apply the comparability of treatment principle between official bilateral and private creditors.\n\n39. We will also consider options to reinforce the resilience of low and vulnerable middle-income countries, by promoting multilateral coordination in connection with IMF/MDB support packages, with the aim of addressing financing challenges and advancing progress towards sustainable development goals while reducing the risk of future debt distress. A country-owned, multidimensional approach, encompassing efforts to improve domestic resource mobilization, ensure successful application of existing financing tools and activate, when needed, creditor coordination and private sector participation, could be supported by the IMF and the World Bank and further discussed by the G20.\n\n40. We reiterate the importance of incorporating Majority Voting Provisions in private syndicated loan contracts. We welcome the development of Climate Resilient Debt Clauses (CRDCs) and encourage more creditors to offer CRDCs in loan and bond agreements. We encourage the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable to continue its work, fostering a constructive and inclusive dialogue among all parties.\n\n41. We recall our commitment to a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF at the centre of the Global Financial Safety Net and its catalytic role in promoting global macroeconomic and financial stability and helping members achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. We strongly support the IMF’s commitment towards the most vulnerable, including through our contributions to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). We reiterate the call on all IMF members who are able to contribute, especially those that have not yet done so, to consider providing financial support. We look forward to a comprehensive and timely review of the PRGT, and we are open to discussing all viable options, including the use of internal resources, to ensure the long-term financial self-sustainability of the PRGT and to help meet the growing needs of low-income countries. We welcome the interim review of the RST and its focus on resilience to climate change and pandemics. We support the creation of a 25th Chair at the IMF Executive Board for Sub-Saharan Africa, which will improve the voice and representation of this region.\n\n42. We remain committed to provide the necessary support to developing countries, and in particular low-income economies, so they can enhance their taxation systems and enforcement capacity and make progress on Sustainable Development Goals. We emphasize the importance for developing countries of a swift implementation of the Two-Pillar Solution. We will continue to work together with international and regional organisations to exploit synergies and strengthen existing initiatives, such as the Platform for Collaboration on Tax and Tax Inspectors Without Borders.\n\nManufacturing African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator43. We support the creation of a sustainable ecosystem for pharmaceutical products along the whole value chain in Africa, which faces particular challenges in manufacturing and supply capacity, recognizing that a high reliance on imports has negative impacts on the availability and accessibility to essential medicines and vaccines. Developing sustainable manufacturing capacity is key to move towards equitable access to UHC and to enhance pandemic PPR. We commend our African partners for their leadership and efforts to enhance pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity and we remain committed to support the development of a sustainable regional industry, such as through the Team Europe Initiatives. We support the Italian Presidency’s intention to gather information on G7 efforts to enhance pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity in African countries, as an important step to improve coordination and to set priorities for future action. We will also explore synergies and complementarity with the initiatives being discussed by G7 Health Ministers and in other fora and support these where relevant.\n\n44. In response to our African partners’ call to establish a sustainable vaccine development and manufacturing ecosystem and fill the gap between local demand and local production, we have further committed to support the Gavi’s African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), initiated under the German G7 Presidency in 2022. We highlight AVMA’s synergetic role and complementarity to the work of African institutions and governments and of other development partners. This will help to catalyze further investments and political commitment to support regional production efforts in Africa.\n\nResilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement partnership\n\n45. We reaffirm the importance of supporting green energy transitions in developing countries, including in the African continent. We support low- and middle-income countries in playing a stronger role in the value chains of clean-energy products. Promoting diversification and resilience is instrumental to achieve global climate targets and to foster sustainable development. With this aim, we encourage ongoing progress on the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE) partnership. In particular, we welcome current analytical work on a cluster of countries including Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Malawi – which has identified opportunities and challenges for the creation of clean-energy value chains – and that a Roadmap outlining technical assistance to create an enabling investment climate has been developed with Zambia. We therefore call on the WBG to further implement this global initiative1 and look forward to the launch of a Local Information Platform in Africa by the end of the year.\n\nAlliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa\n\n46. We support the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa (AGIA) as an innovative financial mechanism of AfDB in partnership with the African Union, Africa50 and other development partners, aimed at mobilizing blended capital to design and develop a USD 10 billion bankable portfolio of transformative green infrastructure projects on the continent. The goal is to accelerate the energy transition, bridge the long-standing infrastructure gap and promote climate resilience. As G7 we will collectively contribute up to USD 150 million in grants, concessional and commercial capital to AGIA and we expect to help leverage around up to USD 3 billion of private sector investment in green infrastructures in Africa.\n\nForum on Well-Being\n\n47. We look forward to the seventh edition of the OECD World Forum on Wellbeing, to be hosted by Italy in Rome on 4-6 November 2024. Building on the legacy of the Japanese Presidency, the Forum aims to promote internationally the adoption of policies fostering wellbeing, sustainability, and the reduction of inequalities, based on evidence and sound data measurement and analysis. The Rome event will focus in particular on the impact of climate change and AI on wellbeing, in line with the priorities of the G7 Finance track.\n\nAnnexes\n\nAnnex I - Finance Track Menu of Policy Options for a Just Transition towards Net-Zero\n\nAnnex II - High-Level Framework for Public-Private Insurance Programmes against Natural Hazards\n\nAnnex III. 2024 Progress Report on Tax Co-operation for the 21st Century.

    "Press Releases\nThe United States and Indonesia Sign $35 Million Debt Swap Agreement to Support Coral Reef Ecosystems\nJuly 8, 2024\nWASHINGTON - The United States of America, the Republic of Indonesia, and four non-governmental organizations (NGOs) (Conservation International (CI), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara, and Yayasan Konservasi Cakrawala Indonesia) signed debt-for-nature swap and coral reef conservation agreements under the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Act (TFCCA) on July 3, 2024. When implemented, the agreements will reduce Indonesia’s debt payments to the United States Government by $35 million over the next nine years. In return, the Government of Indonesia has committed these funds to support grants to protect and restore the country's coral reef ecosystems through the establishment of a conservation fund. Local NGOs will use grants from the conservation fund to support projects that directly benefit the coral reef ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. The fund administrator for the new 2024 coral reef conservation agreement is Yayasan Keanekaragaman Hayati Indonesia (KEHATI), a national organization with a 30 year track record in terrestrial and marine conservation.\n\nThe swap is made possible by contributions from the U.S. Government under the TFCCA, CI, and TNC. Grants provided under the TFCCA program will support activities such as conserving protected areas, improving natural resource management, and supporting the development of sustainable livelihoods for communities that rely on coral reef ecosystems.\n\n“Indonesia is home to some of the most biologically diverse coral reef ecosystems in the world that support the livelihoods of millions of Indonesians. The U.S. Department of Treasury is committed to advancing efforts that protect valuable ecosystems while promoting economic development. The strong collaboration among the United States Government, the Republic of Indonesia, and our NGO partners has made this important agreement possible,” said Assistant Secretary for International Trade and Development, Alexia Latortue.\n\nThis new Indonesia agreement marks the 23rd TFCCA deal, following agreements with Bangladesh, Belize, Botswana, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica (two agreements), El Salvador (two agreements), Guatemala, Indonesia (three agreements), Jamaica, Panama (two agreements), Paraguay, Peru (three agreements) and the Philippines (two agreements). Indonesia benefitted from earlier debt-for-nature swaps with the United States in 2009, 2011 and 2014 that collectively over time generated nearly $70 million for the restoration, conservation, management, and sustainable use of tropical forests. Across all countries, over time, these debt-for-nature programs together will generate more than $415 million to protect tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems.\n\n###",
    "Secretary Statements & Remarks\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at an Inter-American Development Bank Roundtable with Ministers and Private Sector Representatives\nJuly 27, 2024\nAs Prepared for Delivery\n\nThank you, President Goldfajn, for convening this roundtable, and thank you all for joining.  I am glad that we have been able to gather this group here today to discuss how businesses can support sustainable livelihoods and conservation in the Amazon and nature and biodiversity more broadly.\n\nThere is a pressing need to halt and reverse the degradation of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity in the Amazon and globally.  I was heartened to see that the rate of deforestation in the Amazon fell by half in 2023, but there is still much work to be done. This includes maintaining this positive rate of progress while recognizing that other areas important for biodiversity in Brazil, notably the Cerrado, are not seeing the same reversals.\n\nThis is so important because the loss of nature and biodiversity presents a significant economic threat.  Ecosystem services are vital to enabling sectors including agriculture, infrastructure, and tourism to thrive.  The loss of nature is also a key driver of climate change.  We cannot reach our climate goals without addressing deforestation.  But the need to address the loss of nature and biodiversity is also a significant economic opportunity. Conserving and restoring nature at scale can provide economic benefits for communities, businesses, and countries that far exceed the cost of conservation, with results ranging from higher agricultural output to reduced damage from disasters.\n\nThis morning, ministers from the Amazon region, President Goldfajn, and I met to affirm our commitment to protecting nature and biodiversity in the Amazon and to the IDB’s Amazonia Forever, which is helping support sustainable economic development in the region through financing, project preparation, and collaboration.  We are hopeful that this program will incentivize greater private sector investment in the region that supports nature.\n\nThere are many other opportunities for the private sector.  Increasing productivity in currently available agricultural areas can double agricultural production in Brazil without increasing deforestation, according to some estimates.  Businesses investing in their own operations and supply chains can reduce nature-related risks such as water availability.  Even the biodiversity of forests brings many potential business opportunities, as we have seen with the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.  And credible net-zero transition plans and investments in high-integrity carbon credits can both support nature and make economic sense.\n\nThe public sector should be enabling these opportunities.  Governments should be working to leverage domestic policy and resources to catalyze local investment, including through policies and programs in agriculture and infrastructure development.  We are doing this at home in the United States through the Inflation Reduction Act and other policies.\n\nWe are also driving investments in emerging market and developing economies, including through the multilateral development banks and multilateral climate and environment funds.  Projects like the Amazon Bioeconomy Fund, backed by the IDB and the Green Climate Fund, help financial institutions in the region mobilize investments that support nature.  And we are also engaging with asset managers, banks, and pension funds around the world to increase their awareness of new and existing blended finance and derisking tools that can facilitate their pursuit of nature-aligned investments with a reasonable risk-to-return profile.\n\nI understand the companies represented here today have significant ambition to support a thriving and sustainable Amazon region, providing sustainable livelihoods while restoring forests and preventing further deforestation.  I am confident that your commitment, ingenuity, and financing can make a difference.  Today, I very much look forward to hearing how you approach these issues and the opportunities you see and challenges you face as we progress toward shared climate and economic goals.\n\n###"
