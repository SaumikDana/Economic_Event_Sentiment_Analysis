    "Press Releases\nQuarterly Refunding Statement Of Acting Assistant Secretary For Financial Markets Monique Rollins\nAugust 2, 2017\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury is offering $62 billion of Treasury securities to refund approximately $47.3 billion of privately-held Treasury notes maturing on August 15, 2017.  This will raise new cash of approximately $14.7 billion.  The securities are:\n\n-        A 3-year note in the amount of $24 billion, maturing August 15, 2020;\n\n-        A 10-year note in the amount of $23 billion, maturing August 15, 2027; and\n\n-        A 30-year bond in the amount of $15 billion, maturing August 15, 2047.\n\nThe 3-year note will be auctioned on a yield basis at 1:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, August 8, 2017.  The 10-year note will be auctioned on a yield basis at 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, August 9, 2017.  The 30-year bond will be auctioned on a yield basis at 1:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, August 10, 2017.  All of these auctions will settle on Tuesday, August 15, 2017.\n\nThe balance of Treasury financing requirements will be met with the weekly bill auctions, cash management bills, the monthly note and bond auctions, the August 5-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) reopening auction, the September 10-year TIPS reopening auction, the October 30-year TIPS reopening auction, and the regular monthly 2-year Floating Rate Note (FRN) auctions.\n\nProjected Financing Needs\n\nBased on current fiscal forecasts, Treasury intends to maintain coupon issuance sizes at current levels over the upcoming quarter.  Treasury will continue to monitor projected financing needs and make appropriate adjustments as necessary.  Treasury plans to address changes in any seasonal borrowing needs over the next quarter through changes in regular bill auction sizes and/or cash management bills.\n\nDebt Limit\n\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 suspended the debt limit through March 15, 2017.  Since that time, Treasury has been at the debt limit and has been taking extraordinary measures to finance the government on a temporary basis. Based upon available information, Treasury expects to be able to fund the government through the end of September. It is critical that Congress act to increase the nation’s borrowing authority, and Treasury urges Congress to act promptly on this important matter.\n\nFinancing System Open Market Account (SOMA) Portfolio Redemptions\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) June statement and Addendum to the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans signaled expectations for gradual future changes in the Federal Reserve’s reinvestment policy for its SOMA portfolio.  These will affect Treasury’s net marketable borrowing from the public over the coming years.  Specifically, Treasury will need to increase the amount of borrowing from other investors in order to fund these SOMA redemptions.  Treasury will likely respond to the additional borrowing needs associated with SOMA redemptions by increasing both Treasury bill and Treasury nominal coupon auction sizes, beginning with bills and then coupons, as appropriate.\n\nIf and when the timing of the Federal Reserve’s start to SOMA redemptions becomes available, Treasury will provide market participants with further guidance regarding changes to future auction sizes.\n\nPlease send comments and suggestions on these subjects or others related to debt management.  The next quarterly refunding announcement will take place on November 1, 2017.\n\n###",

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created Opportunity Zones to spur investment in distressed communities throughout the country. New investments in Opportunity Zones can receive preferential tax treatment.\n\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, States, D.C., and U.S. possessions nominate low-income communities to be designated as Qualified Opportunity Zones, which are eligible for the tax benefit.  States were required by March 21st to submit nominations or request a 30 day extension to submit nominations. Treasury has 30 days from the date of submission to designate the nominated zones. Treasury today has designated the nominations of all States that submitted by the March 21st deadline.  Treasury will make future designations as submissions by the states that have requested an extension are received and certified.\n\n“I am very excited about the prospects for Opportunity Zones. Attracting needed private investment into these low-income communities will lead to their economic revitalization, and ensure economic growth is experienced throughout the nation,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “The Administration will continue working with States and the private sector to encourage investment and development in Opportunity Zones and other economically disadvantaged areas and boost economic growth and job creation.”\n\nSubmissions were approved today for: American Samoa; Arizona; California; Colorado; Georgia; Idaho; Kentucky; Michigan; Mississippi; Nebraska; New Jersey; Oklahoma; Puerto Rico; South Carolina; South Dakota; Vermont; Virgin Islands; and Wisconsin.  \n\nQualified Opportunity Zones retain this designation for 10 years. Investors can defer tax on any prior gains until no later than December 31, 2026, so long as the gain is reinvested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund, an investment vehicle organized to make investments in Qualified Opportunity Zones.  In addition, if the investor holds the investment in the Opportunity Fund for at least ten years, the investor would be eligible for an increase in its basis equal to the fair market value of the investment on the date that it is sold.\n\nTreasury and the IRS plan to issue additional information on Qualified Opportunity Funds.  The additional guidance will address the certification of Opportunity Funds, which are required to have at least 90 percent of fund assets invested in Opportunity Zones.\n\nView designated Opportunity Zones.\n\n###",

We are delivering on this promise,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “The new, postcard-size Form1040 is designed to simplify and expedite filing tax returns, providing much-needed relief to hardworking taxpayers.”\n\nThis simplified Form 1040 will streamline tax returns so that all 150 million taxpayers can use the same form.

Yellen participated in a virtual discussion with a bi-partisan group of mayors to discuss the unprecedented public health and economic crises that have left millions of Americans struggling to get by, as well as specific challenges facing cities across the country.\n\nThe Secretary highlighted the merits of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which includes $350 billion for state and local governments to do important work like distributing the vaccine and reopening schools to help cities and their citizens make it to the other side of this pandemic. She emphasized the importance of providing flexible aid to cities, so that residents would have access to critical services and mayors could ensure that first-responders, teachers, and other public-sector workers could keep their jobs. The Secretary highlighted the merits of the Child Tax Credit as a lifeline for families buckling under the weight of the pandemic, higher Economic Impact Payments, expanded and well-targeted rental assistance to prevent evictions, and boosting nutritional support to ameliorate the growing hunger crisis in our country. She also discussed the importance of investment in equitable growth, access to capital for institutions that invest in underserved communities, and accessible and equitable Paycheck Protection Program aid for small businesses impacted by the pandemic.\n\nSecretary Yellen made clear the imperative of a comprehensive package designed to help Americans weather the pandemic. She noted the benefits of acting now – and acting big – will far outweigh the costs over the long term, and expressed concern over the number of state and local workers who had lost their jobs in 2020. Secretary Yellen reiterated that a major lesson of the last recession was that the federal government didn’t provide enough aid to states and localities resulting in  sharp cuts in crucial things like infrastructure and education--which ultimately led to a weaker labor market and undercut the broader economic recovery.\n\nThe Secretary was joined by a bipartisan group of six U.S. mayors from around the country, representing a diversity of regions of the country, macroeconomic indicators, and demographics.",
    "Press Releases\nTreasury Establishes New Office to Lead Implementation of Relief and Recovery Programs\nApril 14, 2021\nWASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the establishment of the Office of Recovery Programs to lead the Department’s implementation of economic relief and recovery programs, including nearly $420 billion in programs from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. This new office, which will be led by the Chief Recovery Officer, will report to Treasury’s Deputy Secretary and will be principally focused on efficiently establishing and administering Treasury’s programs to support an equitable and swift recovery from the economic challenges precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Office’s inaugural Chief Recovery Officer is Jacob Leibenluft, who will serve as the lead administrator of recovery programs and the principal advisor to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary on recovery program implementation. The Chief Recovery Officer and staff of the Office will work closely with Gene Sperling, the White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator and Senior Advisor to President Biden.\n\n“A new, cohesive model for recovery program implementation at Treasury will help get relief distributed quickly and into the hands of those who need it most,” said Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo. “Already we are getting individual payments out the door faster and in greater volume than ever before. We hope to continue this improved delivery, while also supporting outreach between Treasury and important stakeholders across the country. We are thrilled that Jacob is willing to take on this portfolio. He has remarkable policy expertise to bring to these programs, and I’m confident that Americans will benefit from his dedication.”\n\n“I am honored to take on this role and look forward to the opportunity to support equity, transparency, and accountability in the implementation of these programs,” said Chief Recovery Officer Jacob Leibenluft. “Treasury will continue to work around the clock to engage with stakeholders, understand the needs in communities across the country, and swiftly implement relief for those who need it most.”\n\nThe Office of Recovery Programs will oversee programs authorized through the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, and the American Rescue Plan Act, as well as other legislation. These programs include the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund, Emergency Rental Assistance, the Homeowner Assistance Fund, the State Small Business Credit Initiative, the Capital Projects Fund, the Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services (CERTS) Program, the Payroll Support Program, the Coronavirus Relief Fund and the Airline and National Security Loan Program.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Office of Recovery Programs, this work was led from disparate offices across the Treasury Department. The Office of Recovery Programs will build on that work and establish a sustainable model for efficiently and effectively implementing these programs that will make it easier for communities, businesses, and households to access relief.\n\nThe implementation of the recovery programs disbursed through the tax code, including Economic Impact Payments and the enhanced Child Tax Credit, will continue to be led by the Office of Tax Policy, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Bureau of Fiscal Service, in coordination with the Office of Recovery Programs.\n\nWhile the Office of Recovery Programs is established, potential stakeholders can reach out to OfficeOfRecoveryPrograms@treasury.gov.\n\n####",

SIFMA is a trade association for broker-dealers, investment banks, and asset managers operating in the United States and global capital markets. SIFMA serves as an industry coordinating body to promote fair and orderly markets, informed regulatory compliance, and efficient market operations and resiliency.\n\nDeputy Secretary Adeyemo discussed the American Jobs Plan, which will create millions of good-paying jobs, rebuild infrastructure, and position the United States for a successful recovery and a growth trajectory. He stressed how President Biden’s Jobs Plan will invest in the United States workforce and strengthen our job market to restore American competitiveness abroad. The Deputy Secretary also discussed President Biden’s Made in America Tax Plan, and how the proposal rewards work, not wealth. The Deputy Secretary noted that the goal of the Made in America Tax Plan is to make American companies and workers more competitive by eliminating incentives to offshore investment, substantially reducing profit shifting, countering tax competition on corporate rates, and providing tax preferences for clean energy production. He also discussed how the tax plan would generate new funding to pay for a sustained increase in investments in infrastructure, research, and support for manufacturing, fully paying for the investments in the American Jobs Plan.\n\nDeputy Secretary Adeyemo discussed the Treasury Department’s review of United States economic and financial sanctions, which have become the tool of first resort to address a range of national security, foreign policy, and economic challenges. He explained that while this tool has resulted in notable successes, it has also created unanticipated challenges. The Deputy Secretary stressed that moving forward, and as the United States faces a changing international order, the Treasury Department is assessing the costs and benefits of sanctions use in each case with an eye towards ensuring they remain a strong, viable option for policymakers in the years and decades to come. Finally, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo noted that the sanctions review will seek to ensure that the Department’s implementation and enforcement of sanctions are relevant, rigorous, and fit to purpose, while advancing United States goals.\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nMore than 1.1 million additional Economic Impact Payments disbursed under the American Rescue Plan; payments total approximately 164 million\nMay 5, 2021\nWASHINGTON — Today, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service announced they are disbursing more than 1.1 million payments in the eighth batch of Economic Impact Payments from the American Rescue Plan.\n\nToday’s announcement brings the total disbursed so far to approximately 164 million payments, with a total value of approximately $386 billion, since these payments began rolling out to Americans in batches as announced on March 12.\n\nThe eighth batch of payments began processing on Friday, April 30, with an official payment date of May 5, with some people receiving direct payments in their accounts earlier as provisional or pending deposits. Here is additional information on this batch of payments:\n\nAdditional information is available on the first seven batches of Economic Impact Payments from the American Rescue Plan, which processed weekly on April 23, April 16, April 9, April 2, March 26, March 19 and March 12.\n\nThe IRS will continue to make Economic Impact Payments on a weekly basis. Ongoing payments will be sent to eligible individuals for whom the IRS previously did not have information to issue a payment but who recently filed a tax return, as well to people who qualify for “plus-up” payments.\n\nSpecial reminder for those who don't normally file a tax return\n\nAlthough payments are automatic for most people, the IRS continues to urge people who don’t normally file a tax return and haven’t received Economic Impact Payments to file a 2020 tax return to get all the benefits they’re entitled to under the law, including tax credits such as the 2020 Recovery Rebate Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Filing a 2020 tax return will also assist the IRS in determining whether someone is eligible for an advance payment of the 2021 Child Tax Credit, which will begin to be disbursed this summer.\n\nFor example, some federal benefits recipients may need to file a 2020 tax return – even if they don't usually file – to provide information the IRS needs to send payments for a qualifying dependent. Eligible individuals in this group should file a 2020 tax return as quickly as possible to be considered for an additional payment for their qualifying dependents.\n\nPeople who don't normally file a tax return and don't receive federal benefits may qualify for these Economic Impact Payments. This includes those experiencing homelessness, the rural poor, and others. Individuals who didn't get a first or second round Economic Impact Payment or got less than the full amounts may be eligible for the 2020 Recovery Rebate Credit, but they’ll need to file a 2020 tax return. See the special section on IRS.gov: Claiming the 2020 Recovery Rebate Credit if you aren't required to file a tax return.\n\nFree tax return preparation is available for qualifying people.\n\nThe IRS reminds taxpayers that the income levels in this third round of Economic Impact Payments have changed. This means that some people won't be eligible for the third payment even if they received a first or second Economic Impact Payment or claimed a 2020 Recovery Rebate Credit. Payments will begin to be reduced for individuals making $75,000 or above in Adjusted Gross Income ($150,000 for married filing jointly). The payments end at $80,000 for individuals ($160,000 for married filing jointly); people with Adjusted Gross Incomes above these levels are ineligible for a payment.\n\nIndividuals can check the Get My Payment tool on IRS.gov to see the payment status of these payments.

The call featured comments from White House and Treasury officials and a demonstration of the new tool by Code for America. The call also included a wide range of organizations that have been actively engaged in CTC outreach efforts and offered guidance on how they can help raise awareness and drive enrollments through the new tool. Leaders of grassroots organizations also spoke on the call about their shared commitment to ensuring the advance CTC reaches every possible eligible family.\n\nAdministration officials emphasized that the launch of this tool is the latest step in an all-out effort to help more Americans who do not regularly file taxes to claim their CTC. They also reiterated that while the Code for America tool is an important and necessary resource to help more families this tax season, the Administration remains committed to creating a permanent, fully resourced, multi-lingual, and mobile-friendly government sign-up tool.  This commitment is part of the Biden Administration’s efforts to extend the expanded CTC program. Officials also reiterated their commitment to working with Congress to provide the necessary funding for a multi-year effort — leveraging public sector and community-oriented solutions — to reach and sign up more families and children.\n\nTreasury and White House officials highlighted recent data showing how this monthly tax relief is already helping families with the costs of raising children – from the most basic expenses to paying dental bills, helping with afterschool and summer activities, or getting extra help for school. According the Census Household Pulse Survey, food instability among all families with children fell by 24% immediately after the first payments went out. A Columbia analysis found that low-income families with children who received the first monthly payment experienced a 43% decline in food insufficiency.\n\nThe Administration will link to the new sign-up portal – GetCTC.org – and over the coming weeks, the Administration will host dozens of navigator trainings on the new Code for American portal for public sector and community-based organizations seeking to enroll non-filers in the Child Tax Credit.",

Signed into law in March 2021, the ARP has helped communities in southern California and across the country avert a deep and sustained economic downturn while laying a strong foundation for future growth.\n\nDeputy Secretary Adeyemo first joined the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce for a roundtable with business leaders and discussed ways the federal government can work together with the private sector and local leaders to maximize the impact of federal relief funding.\n \nDeputy Secretary Adeyemo then visited Ralph M. Parsons Preschool, a Los Angeles public preschool which received ARP funds through the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds program to reopen its facility during the pandemic. The SLFRF program provides state and local governments with $350 billion in flexible funding to respond to the pandemic and make long-term investments in their communities to build a stronger, more resilient and more equitable economy.\n \nLastly, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo toured Tierra del Sol, a multi-family low-income housing development located in the Canoga Park area of Los Angeles. The Emergency Rental Assistance program, funded in part by the American Rescue Plan, has provided a critical lifeline to renters, preventing a devastating wave of evictions while helping to build a nationwide rental assistance infrastructure. As of September 30, 2022, ERA programs have made over 9.7 million payments to households at risk of eviction totaling more than $30 billion, more than $4 billion of which has gone to California families. In addition to ERA resources, over $14 billion in SLFRF resources have been committed to nearly 1,800 projects to meet housing needs, over $4.5 billion of which have been committed to affordable housing development and preservation.",

    "Press Releases\nTreasury Department Announces Awards to Connect More Families and Businesses to High-Speed Internet as Part of President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda\nMay 15, 2023\nDelaware, Idaho approved to receive approximately $185.9 million under the American Rescue Plan\n\nCombined with other Administration initiatives, President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has brought affordable internet to over 17 million American households\n\nWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the approval of federal funds for multi-purpose community facility projects and broadband infrastructure projects in Delaware and Idaho under the American Rescue Plan’s Capital Projects Fund (CPF), part of President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda. A key priority of the CPF program is expanding economic opportunities and providing internet connectivity in communities with unmet needs. Already, President Biden’s Investing in America agenda has delivered affordable, high-speed internet to 17 million American households, through the CPF funded by the American Rescue Plan, and through the Affordable Connectivity Program funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\n“Digital connectivity is central to expanding economic opportunity in communities across the country,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “This funding is a key piece of the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic investments to increase access to high-speed internet for millions of Americans and provide more opportunities to fully participate in the 21st century economy.”\n\n“We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with ARPA capital funds to build a better future for the next generation of Delawareans,” said Governor Carney. “The capital projects announced today aim to expand economic opportunities for Delaware families, dedicate resources to make sure children have access to the education they deserve, and large investments in our communities – especially those hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to thank the Congressional delegation for their advocacy and look forward to seeing significant results from these investments.”\n\n“I was proud to work on provisions in the American Rescue Plan that helps those working on the front lines with Delawareans that need help the most,” said U.S. Senator Tom Carper. “From my time as Governor, I’ve worked on strengthening families, and these funds are going to improve the organizations that help uplift so many families in our state. These organizations often invest so much of their resources into their missions – whether it’s providing shelter, services for our veterans, substance abuse treatment, job training or after-school activities for children – and these funds will help them improve their facilities so they can better serve our communities.”\n\n“It’s great to see funds from the American Rescue Plan that Democrats and President Biden enacted coming to Delaware in all three counties,” said U.S Senator Chris Coons. “From job skills workshops to community programs to addressing nutritional insecurity, this announcement is making a difference in the lives of Delawareans up and down the state. I can’t wait to see all of these visions for each one of these dozens of projects become reality in the coming months and years.”\n\n“Today is a prime example of how we’re continuing to see historic investments being made in Delaware because of the American Rescue Plan Act,” said Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester. “The impact from these capital projects won’t just ensure that these organizations are able to fulfill their missions to provide critical services – from health care and mental health to job training and entrepreneurship – but will help us improve the quality of life for Delawareans in every part of our state.”\n\nThe CPF provides a total of $10 billion to states, territories, freely associated states, and Tribal governments to fund critical capital projects that enable work, education, and health monitoring. In addition to the $10 billion provided by the CPF, many governments are putting a portion of their State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) toward meeting the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of connecting every American household to affordable, reliable high-speed internet. Together, these American Rescue Plan programs and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are working in tandem with President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to close the digital divide – deploying high-speed internet to those without access and lowering costs for those who cannot afford it.\n\nIn accordance with the Treasury Department’s guidance, each state’s plan requires service providers to participate in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) new Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The Affordable Connectivity Program, funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, helps ensure that households can afford high-speed internet by providing a discount of up to $30 per month (or up to $75 per eligible household on Tribal lands). Experts estimate that nearly 40% of U.S. households are eligible for the program.\n\nTo further lower costs, President Biden and Vice President Harris announced last year that the Administration had secured commitments from 20 leading internet service providers—covering more than 80% of the U.S. population—to offer all ACP-eligible households high-speed, reliable internet plans for no more than $30 per month. As a result of this agreement and the ACP, eligible households can receive internet access at no cost and can check their eligibility and sign up at GetInternet.gov.\n\nThe Treasury Department began announcing state awards in June of last year.  To date, CPF has awarded approximately $6.5 billion for broadband, digital technology, and multi-purpose community center projects in 41 states. States estimate that the broadband investments will reach more than 1.83 million locations. The Department will continue approving state and Tribal plans on a rolling basis.\n\nThe following descriptions summarize the Idaho and Delaware plans that Treasury approved today:\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nEconomy Statement by Eric Van Nostrand, Acting Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy, for the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee July 31, 2023\nJuly 31, 2023\nThe U.S. economy continued to show resilience and strength in the second quarter of 2023.  Real GDP grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, picking up slightly from the pace in the first quarter.  Labor markets remained tight: payroll job growth was strong and unemployment rates remained near historically low levels.  Labor supply—particularly among prime-age (ages 25-54) workers—increased while labor demand cooled modestly, though high levels of job openings indicated that demand remains firm.  Although inflation remained elevated in the second quarter, it has eased over the past several months.  Measured year-over-year, headline inflation was the lowest since April 2021, reflecting a significant reduction in energy and food prices.  And while core inflation remains above the Fed’s target, price pressures on other goods have eased on balance.  Furthermore, inflation for housing rent as well as other core services has slowly eased.  While much remains uncertain, this progress indicates that a path toward a “soft landing” remains viable.\n\nEven so, the U.S. economy faces important headwinds moving into the second half of 2023.  Slowing global economic growth has weighed on demand for U.S. exports, and geopolitical shocks could renew price pressures if supply chains are further disrupted.  Indeed, unwelcome upward shocks to inflation may introduce instability to parts of the financial system and endanger that soft landing toward which the U.S. economy is currently tracking.  To date, however, most economic indicators have been encouraging. Neither GDP nor other popular business cycle indicators suggest near-term contraction.  Only two indicators—real manufacturing and trade sales and industrial production—showing weakness specific to the manufacturing sector, but all others used by the NBER for business cycle dating have shown net growth, year to date.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, real GDP growth accelerated to 2.4 percent at an annual rate, picking up from a 2.0 percent gain in the first quarter (see Table 1 - Real Gross Domestic Product).  Stronger growth in business fixed investment (BFI) drove the acceleration, along with an upturn in private inventory investment, which was partly offset by a wider net export deficit and slower, but still positive, growth in household consumption and government purchases.\n\nWe decompose GDP into four components: (1) private final domestic purchases (PDFP), the most persistent and stable components of output including personal consumption, business fixed investment, and residential investment; (2) government consumption and investment; (3) net international purchases; and (4) intermediate demand (or change in private inventories).  Examined separately, each component delivers specific information about activity in various sectors that can be useful in predicting the future path of growth.  The PDFP measure is especially telling of the private sector’s capacity to drive self-sustaining growth and as such, can signal the direction of future economic performance.  In the second quarter, real PDFP growth slowed to 2.3 percent at an annual rate but still contributed 2.0 percentage points to total GDP growth—a robust figure given our supply-side growth.\n\nFirst, we review changes in the components of PDFP.  Household consumption growth eased in the second quarter, largely reflecting a marked slowdown in demand for durable goods.  Goods consumption was led by purchases of recreational goods and vehicles, as well as gasoline and other energy goods, but purchases of motor vehicles declined in the second quarter, after a sizeable gain in the first quarter.  The rotation in spending from goods to services persisted.  Although consumption of services grew at a slower rate than in Q1, it still outpaced purchases of goods, with services adding nearly six times more to real GDP growth than goods consumption.  Services spending growth was largely due to housing and utilities, health care, and financial services and insurance—which together accounted for 1.0 percentage points of services growth.  By contrast, consumption of food services and accommodations declined for the first time since 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, business fixed investment accelerated in the second quarter, reflecting a sharp swing in spending on equipment after two consecutive quarters of decline.  The reversal in equipment spending was led by increased purchases of transportation equipment.  Investment in structures remained very strong, even after slowing by about one-third from the double-digit advances in the previous two quarters.  Businesses continued to invest heavily in manufacturing factories and—to a lesser degree—other structures, which offset declines in spending in health care, power and communications, and mining exploration.\n\nThe final component of PDFP, residential investment, continued to constrain overall GDP growth but at the same rate as in the first quarter.  Spending on other structures, a category that includes brokers’ commissions and home improvements, drove the decline.  By contrast, single-family home construction investment was positive for the first time since early 2022, while investment in multi-family buildings also increased.\n\nThe other three categories of GDP made mixed contributions to the overall expansion in the second quarter.  After two quarters of rapid growth, total government spending growth slowed significantly in the second quarter, owing to a sharp pull-back in federal non-defense consumption expenditures.  Other federal government spending growth held relatively steady, while state and local government spending growth decelerated modestly.  International trade was a net negative contributor to real GDP growth as exports of goods fell markedly amid slowing global economic growth; total imports also fell sharply, but less rapidly than did exports.  Meanwhile, the change in private inventories, which can exhibit wide swings from quarter to quarter, made a small contribution in the second quarter, adding 0.1 percentage points to growth after subtracting 2.1 percentage points from first quarter GDP growth.  The build was led by durable goods in both wholesale and manufacturing--as well as retail trade, particularly inventories of motor vehicles.\n\nThe labor market remained tight during the second quarter of 2023, even as the signs of easing which began late last year also became more noticeable (see Table 2 – Labor Market Indicators).  The pace of payroll job creation slowed to 244,000 jobs per month, down from the first quarter average of 312,000 per month.  Nonetheless, even this slower pace is more than adequate to maintain a stable rate of unemployment.  In fact, the headline unemployment rate returned in April to January’s half-century low of 3.4 percent, before edging up to 3.6 percent at the very end of the second quarter—still very near historical lows.  The ”underemployment” rate, or “U-6”—which includes those working part-time for economic reasons and those marginally-attached to the labor force—moved up to 6.9 percent at the end of the second quarter, or 0.4 percentage points above the record low of 6.5 percent set in December 2022 (series dates from January 1994).  Nonetheless, this rate is still well below the 2019 average rate of 7.2 percent.\n\nThe gap between labor supply and demand in the economy continued to narrow in the second quarter. The supply of labor consolidated gains seen in the first quarter: after moving up noticeably to 62.6 percent by the end of the first quarter, the labor force participation rate (LFPR) for all workers remained at that level throughout the second quarter.  Some groups of workers saw sizeable increases in participation, while others moved out of the labor force.  The LFPR for prime-age workers made substantial gains, rising to 83.5 percent by the end of the second quarter—a 21-year high.  Notably, the LFPR for prime-age women rose to the highest rate on record at 77.8 percent (data starts in 1948).  By contrast, participation by older workers dropped 0.3 percentage points over the second quarter, from 38.6 percent in March 2023 to 38.3 percent in June – or 2.0 percentage points below the 40.3 percent rate posted in February 2020—though the decrease is consistent with broader demographic trends.  Overall, the supply of labor has increased of late while the demand for labor has moved somewhat lower.  The number of job openings has trended down since March 2022: as of May 2023 (latest available data), there were 1.6 jobs per unemployed worker, the lowest ratio since October 2021—though still well above the pre-pandemic ratio of 1.2 vacancies per unemployed worker.  The decline in this ratio signals improvement in the balance between labor supply and demand.  Meanwhile, weekly unemployment insurance claims moved higher in the second quarter—though they remain at historically low levels.  On average, initial claims averaged 241,000 in the second quarter, up 9.5 percent from the first quarter.  Meanwhile, continuing claims were up 3.2 percent from the first quarter at 1.79 million, again near historically low levels.\n\nInflation: Inflation slowed further in the second quarter.  As measured by the consumer price index (CPI), average monthly inflation was 0.3 percent in the first quarter, dropping to 0.2 percent during the second quarter (see Table 3 – Inflation and Wage Growth Indicators).  Average monthly food inflation in the second quarter was one-third the pace in the previous quarter, partly reflecting lower prices for eggs, various meats, and dairy and related products.  Meanwhile, energy prices have been declining on net since June 2022, with energy prices falling 0.8 percent on average per month in the second quarter. The outlook for energy, however, is uncertain.  Saudi Arabia again tried to bolster oil prices in early July with an extension of production cuts through August.  Yet rising production by OPEC and non-OPEC members—for example, U.S. crude oil production is on track to hit a new record-high level in 2023—has undermined sustained price increases, as had slowing global growth and energy demand.\n\nExcluding energy and food, disinflation among other goods and services has been slow overall, given sustained upward pressure from rent of housing services.  Over the second quarter, core inflation averaged 0.3 percent per month, down from 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2023.  Core goods prices accelerated in the second quarter, related to an early-quarter surge in used car and truck prices.  However, upstream price pressures, as captured by producer and import prices, receded at faster rates in the second quarter, which may augur toward further slowing in consumer prices in coming months.  For core non-housing services, inflation slowed significantly in the second quarter—roughly one-fourth of the first quarter pace—in part due to deflationary pressures among tourism and recreation services.  Meanwhile, inflation for rent of housing services continues to exert upward pressure on core inflation, albeit at a slightly slower pace in the second quarter.  The slowing trend, which started in October 2022, may not be sustained.  Upward pressures on inflation could renew within the next year as market measures of rents have started to increase in recent months and house prices have risen steadily since early 2023.  Changes in rents and house prices are generally reflected in the CPI roughly a year later.\n\nInflation as measured by the PCE price index assigns different weights for different components and uses a different methodology in its calculation than the CPI.  Nonetheless, the drivers of both measures of inflation and the patterns in the second quarter are broadly similar.\n\nWage Growth: Measures of wage growth in the private sector increased in the second quarter, even after adjusting for inflation.  Average hourly earnings rose at a 4.7 percent annualized rate from March through June 2023, faster than pre-pandemic gains but still slower than the outsized paces registered through most of 2022.  After adjusting for inflation, real average hourly earnings increased, posting broad-based and positive annualized growth in the second quarter after easing slightly in the first quarter.  But an alternative measure of wage growth, the Employment Cost Index (ECI), suggests that wage pressures did moderate in the second quarter.  Over the four quarters through the second quarter of 2023, the ECI for private sector wages and salaries was slower by more than a full percentage point than the rate over the previous four quarters.  Wage growth in goods-producing industries slowed dramatically in the second quarter, while that in service-producing industries was stable relative to the first quarter at an elevated rate.  The ECI controls for employment shares among industries and occupations, making it a better reference for wage growth.\n\nThe current cycle of interest rate increases has weighed noticeably on housing market activity.  Even so, signs of stabilization began appearing in the first quarter of 2023 and persisted into the second quarter—with some metrics suggesting the sector has turned.  For example, the National Association of Homebuilders’ confidence index has improved consistently since December.  Moreover, the survey started signaling a favorable outlook in June 2023 for the first time since mid-2022.\n\nNew Residential Construction: On balance, new home construction was positive in the second quarter, but demand appeared to be diverging between the single-family and multi-family sectors (see Table 4 – Housing Market Indicators).  New single-family home construction continued to firm, given low inventories of existing homes available for sale.  Growth of single-family building permits—which precede future single-family construction—remained strong in the second quarter, growing slightly faster than in the first quarter.  The decline in multi-family permits continued, however.  Reversing the pattern in the previous quarter, growth in single-family starts was robust and offset a decline in the volatile multi-family sector.\n\nNonetheless, the multi-family sector is poised for future growth: the backlog of new multi-family units (those authorized but not started) remains at an elevated level, roughly 70 percent higher than at the end of 2020.  As a share of the total residential construction backlog, the multifamily sector accounted for roughly half, up from roughly 40 percent in mid-2021.  Moreover, although the total inventory of homes under construction declined modestly in the first and second quarters, the number of multi-family units under construction continued to climb, reaching a fresh record high in the second quarter; and completions for multi-family homes rose further above pre-pandemic norms.\n\nHomes Sales and Inventories: After growing solidly in the first quarter, sales of total existing homes declined in the second quarter and were also down by nearly 20 percent over the year ending in June 2023. Moreover, the number of existing homes available for sale fell by nearly 7 percent over the year ending the second quarter—well below similar time periods before the pandemic and suggesting an ongoing reluctance among homeowners to exchange their low-rate mortgages for materially higher rates along with elevated home prices.\n\nMeanwhile, sales of new single-family homes have risen for four consecutive quarters, with growth accelerating to 2.9 percent in the second quarter from 0.2 percent in the previous quarter.  The upward trend in sales for the past year has weighed more heavily on the inventory to sales ratios for new homes.  From a post-pandemic peak of 10.1 months in July 2022, the ratio dropped to a 15-month low of 7.2 months of supply in May 2023 and, for the second quarter as a whole, stood at 7.5 months.\n\nHome Prices and Rents: Home price inflation accelerated markedly in the second quarter, rising back above pre-pandemic trends (see Table 5 – Home Price and Rent Indicators).  From June 2022 to December 2022, both primary measures of house prices declined on net, but they began increasing again early in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting the combination of low inventories and solid demand.  Both the S&P/Case-Shiller index and the FHFA purchase only-index rebounded noticeably in the second quarter to date (April and May).  As of May 2023, the S&P/Case-Shiller’s national home price index was within 1 percent of the June 2022 peak, while the FHFA’s measure reached a fresh record-high reading.\n\nShelter cost growth continued to ease slightly for non-owners according to official statistics—but from elevated levels—while measures of new rental agreements showed an upturn.  Growth in the CPI for rent of primary residence slowed to 6.2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter – still rapid, but roughly two-thirds the pace seen in each of the final two quarters of 2022.  However, the CPI for rent is a lagged measure, trailing prices from rental unit listing services by about four quarters.  These services showed that rental inflation more than doubled in the second quarter, after decelerating from summer 2021 through the first quarter of this year, as would-be buyers chose renting over rising mortgage rates and high home prices, amidst a dearth of available supply available for sale.\n\nRisks to the Banking System: The banking system is sound and well-capitalized, but financial instability remains an important risk to monitor.  Higher interest rates continue to pose heightened risks of asset/liability mismatch for banks.  Moreover, uneven banking system exposure to commercial real estate loans may put pressure on some smaller banks.  The U.S. government is committed to taking actions to maintain financial stability.\n\nInflation: Although inflation has fallen from the highs of mid-2022, it remains well above pre-pandemic rates and the Federal Reserve’s target.  The paths of energy and food prices remain highly uncertain and face further risk from weather and geopolitical developments in the months ahead. Adverse shocks—including related to Russia’s ongoing brutal war in Ukraine, on both energy and food prices—could result in temporary boosts of near-term headline inflation.  Secondary effects could filter into core components of inflation over time.  Excluding food and energy prices, core inflation is likely to stay above the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target throughout 2023, reflecting elevated inflation for housing rent as well as other core services.  Inflationary pressures from rent are expected to ease in the coming months based on slowing in rents for new lease agreements, although recent data suggest potential upside risk for rent inflation in the coming months.  Core services excluding rent of housing inflation is also likely to remain elevated through 2023 but is expected to continue easing in response to higher interest rates.\n\nInterest Rates and the Housing Market: Although higher mortgage rates have reduced affordability as well as transaction volumes, home prices remain substantially above the pre-pandemic trend.  Risks have shifted as the housing market has stabilized.  Largely due to low supply, house prices have started increasing.  Combined with higher mortgage rates, this means the market faces greater risks in terms of affordability and reduced dynamism.  It also implies a risk that higher rents could lead to more persistent rental inflation.\n\nGeopolitical Risks: Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to add uncertainty to the medium-term outlook.  In addition, uncertainty about China’s economic prospects has created concern about global demand in the coming months. At the same time, central banks around the world are continuing to tighten monetary policy to fight high global rates of inflation.  A potential slowdown in global economic activity may feed back into the U.S. economy by weakening international demand for U.S. goods and service exports.\n\nThe American economy remains strong, bolstered by President Biden’s economic plan and Secretary Yellen’s approach to modern supply-side economics.  Over the past two and a half years, the Biden-Harris Administration has made significant investments to lower costs and strengthen our economy.  These investments will boost economic potential and make our economy more resilient to risks.\n\nAverage Monthly Change\n\n(thousands)\n\nAnnual

    "Press Releases\nU.S. Department of the Treasury Announces New Funding to Support Technical Assistance for Small Businesses as Part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America Agenda\nJuly 2, 2024\nWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the approval of plans for an additional $10 million in technical assistance (TA) funding allocated to four states, two territories, the District of Columbia, and one Tribal government under the American Rescue Plan Act’s State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) TA Grant Program. Included in these approvals is the first SSBCI TA grant for a Tribal government.\n\nPart of President Biden’s economic agenda, the SSBCI TA Grant Program supports programs that provide legal, accounting, and financial advisory services to qualifying small businesses. Treasury allocated $200 million by formula to states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments for the TA Grant Program and, as of today, has announced awards totaling over $145 million.\n\n“Today’s announcement reinforces President Biden’s commitment to invest in small businesses and entrepreneurs,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “Providing help to entrepreneurs like accounting services and legal advice is critical to unlocking their potential for growth and to continuing the nation’s historic small business boom.”\n\nReauthorized and expanded by the American Rescue Plan Act, SSBCI is a nearly $10 billion program to support small businesses and entrepreneurship in communities across the United States to promote small business stability, growth, and success- in states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments. In addition to the TA Grant Program, Treasury also administers the SSBCI Capital Program, where participating jurisdictions implement credit and equity/venture capital programs to provide capital to small businesses.\n\nThe first Tribal government to receive a TA grant is Levelock Village. Approved for $65,327 in TA grant funding, Levelock Village will use contractors to provide legal and financial advisory services to underserved and very small businesses participating in the Tribe’s SSBCI-supported direct investment program (previously approved for up to $627,054) or seeking other small business support. TA programs like that of Levelock Village – a remote Alaska community accessible only by air or water travel with an economy that relies on local fishing and hunting – will support access to capital and small business support services in Indian Country, which are often banking and TA deserts.\n\nThe $10 million TA investment also included four states, two territories, and the District of Columbia. This includes Minnesota, which was approved for $1,972,321 in TA grant funding, and will use the Minnesota Small Business Development Center (SBDC) statewide network within the Minnesota Department of Employment & Economic Development to implement its TA program. The SBDC lead center will coordinate with its nine regional SBDC offices around the state, as well as other business service organizations, to identify eligible beneficiaries. Under the management of the SBDC, TA contractors will provide eligible legal and accounting services.\n\nWith today’s announcement, Treasury has announced the approvals of SSBCI TA grants totaling over $145 million and representing 48 states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments. Treasury anticipates additional approvals of applications from Tribal governments to follow. See the full list of approved programs here.\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nU.S. Department of the Treasury Highlights $4.8 Million Award to Help Mississippi Small Businesses Grow and Hire\nOctober 10, 2024\nWASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) highlighted the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA)’s $4.8 million award to support small business growth. This award is one of 14 recently announced through the Biden-Harris Administration’s State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) Investing in America Small Business Opportunity Program (SBOP). Mississippi’s initiative will be supported by $2.2 million in matching funds from Innovate Mississippi.\n\nAs part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s economic agenda, this $75 million program provides funding to connect underserved and very small businesses to the capital needed to participate in key Investing in America supply chains, including electric vehicle manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing, construction, transportation, clean energy generation, and more. The SBOP was designed to catalyze additional private sector investment by supporting small business technical assistance services like accounting and legal services.\n\n“The Biden-Harris Administration’s economic agenda is focused on continuing the historic small business boom by helping entrepreneurs across the country succeed,” said U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “With this new funding, Mississippi will increase access to capital and customers for both high growth startups and Main Street small businesses, and will allow businesses to seize new opportunities created by investments in advanced manufacturing.”\n\n“Today’s announcement to fund critical small business technical assistance programs will help ensure that more small businesses can thrive, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration plan that is powering a small business boom with a record 19 million new business applications so far,” said National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard.\n\n\"This award is an opportunity to increase small business participation in Mississippi. It's very much needed, and I look forward to full-throated engagement with the small business community”, said U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson.\n\n“Small business is the backbone of the Mississippi economy, and these federal funds will further enhance Mississippi’s already strong support of this part of our economy,” said Mississippi Development Authority Executive Director Bill Cork.\n\nMDA was selected for the SBOP award through a competitive process. MDA will work alongside the Mississippi Small Business Development Center Network (MSBDCN) and Innovate Mississippi (Innovate MS) to assist Mississippi companies in preparing for growth funding. Using this $4.8 million, as well as $2.2 million in matching funds from Innovate Mississippi, MDA will launch ConnectMS, a project aimed to address gaps in the state's entrepreneurial ecosystem, focusing on helping very small businesses (VSBs) and underserved businesses prepare to raise capital.\n\nThe ConnectMS project will span all of Mississippi’s 82 counties, utilizing state-wide regional clusters to scale business programming and increase access to capital for startups and VSBs. The project will include a five-step approach, which includes the FoundersPlus and CoBuilders Accelerator. FoundersPlus will offer entrepreneurial education and a weekly webinar series, and the CoBuilders Accelerator will provide a multi-week virtual program that will support access to venture capital for startups. The program will also establish a Virtual Small Business Incubator, helping traditional businesses access funding through workshops, one-on-one counseling, pitch events, and tailored technical assistance.\n\nSelected SBOP jurisdictions will build or expand technical assistance programs focused on connecting very small and underserved businesses to financing available through SSBCI, or other state or federal small business programs, including in the infrastructure, manufacturing, clean energy, or climate resiliency space. Jurisdictions have been selected based on their plans to create innovative, high-impact models of small business technical assistance delivery that demonstrate a vision to improve access to capital for historically overlooked businesses across the nation.\n\nA fact sheet summarizing all 14 SBOP awards can be found here.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan Act reauthorized and expanded SSBCI, which provides nearly $10 billion to support small businesses and empower them to access the capital needed to invest in job-creating opportunities. SSBCI provides funds to states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments to promote American entrepreneurship, support small business ownership, and democratize access to capital across the country, including in underserved communities. Through the SSBCI Capital Program, Treasury has approved plans for small business financing programs totaling over $8.7 billion and representing every state and territory, the District of Columbia, and 280 Tribal governments.\n\nIn addition to today’s announcement, Treasury has announced the approvals of SSBCI Technical Assistance grants allocated by formula to states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments, representing $145 million for 48 jurisdictions. Treasury anticipates additional approvals of applications to follow. See the full list of approved formula SSBCI Technical Assistance programs here.\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nEconomy Statement for the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee\nNovember 3, 2025\nEconomic data received through September 30, 2025, suggest that U.S. economic growth solidified in the third quarter of 2025 with steady business investment and consumer demand. Stock markets reached record highs during the quarter—and have set additional highs since—while earnings growth has been stable. Meanwhile, yields on U.S. Treasury notes and bills eased over the third quarter: the average yield on the 91-day bill was 11 basis points lower from the second quarter, while the 10-year note yield was 10 basis points lower. Yields have eased further over the last month, nearing 4.00 percent for both the 91-day and the 10-year issuances.\n\nLabor markets stabilized in July and August, with modest employment growth consistent with that of the second quarter. Forced deportation and voluntary self-deportation of illegal immigrants has reduced labor supply, but labor demand has similarly decreased. This has kept aggregate labor markets roughly in balance. With modest hiring but low layoff rates, firms appear to be planning for output growth via productivity improvements.\n\nPrivate-sector forecasters estimate that, given data released for July and August, total economic growth remained solid in the third quarter. According to the most recent publicly available survey (the Wall Street Journal quarterly survey published on October 12, 2025), the median forecast for third-quarter GDP growth was 2.7 percent at an annual rate – an upswing from the July survey median of 1.0 percent annualized growth. This upward revision reflects monthly data that suggests strong private final domestic demand.\n\nThe lapse in government funding has delayed surveys and reports that are used to estimate GDP for the third quarter of 2025. As such, official data on real GDP growth last quarter will not be available until after normal government operations resume.\n\nLabor market data was relatively steady in the first two quarters of the third quarter (see Table 1 – Labor Market Indicators). Monthly job growth moderated slightly, while the average unemployment rate ticked up only slightly and the average headline labor force participation rate (LFPR) ticked down.\n\nInflation remained above the target of 2 percent in the third quarter (see Table 2 – Inflation Indicators). As of September 2025, inflation—as measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI)—was 3.0 percent on a twelve-month basis. The elevated annual growth partly reflects the strong price pressures from September 2024 to January 2025, in which headline CPI rose by 4.1 percent at an annualized rate. From January 2025 to September 2025, CPI growth was more moderate at 2.5 percent at an annual rate.\n\nMonthly core CPI inflation averaged 0.3 percent in the third quarter. Over the twelve months through September 2025, the core inflation rate was 3.0 percent. So far this year, annual core inflation has ranged between 2.8 percent and 3.1 percent, save for the 3.3 percent rating realized in January from when President Trump assumed office.\n\nInflation as measured by the PCE price index has notable differences in weights and methodologies versus the CPI. Over the past 20 years, twelve-month CPI inflation has exceeded PCE inflation by about 0.36 percentage points on average. Over the year through August 2025, headline PCE inflation was 2.7 percent, or 0.2 percentage points below headline CPI inflation for that month. Similarly, core PCE inflation was 2.9 percent, below the 3.1 percent inflation rate as measured by the CPI.\n\nLooking ahead to the next few quarters, the outlook for the U.S. economy faces upside and downside risks. However, on balance, economists view the risk of a recession as relatively low. According to The Wall Street Journal’s quarterly survey of economists, the median economist projected a 33 percent chance of a recession in the next twelve months, little changed from the 35 percent chance estimated by the median economist in the July survey.\n\nFederal government shutdown: As of October 31, the federal government has been shut down for over four weeks, and the lapse in government funding is likely to continue for at least a fifth week. The shutdown reduces current quarter GDP growth through several channels: a direct channel of lost output from furloughed workers, a secondary consumption channel as excepted and furloughed federal workers await delayed paychecks, and ancillary impacts on complementary industries (such as government contractors and local services). Each week of this unnecessary shutdown adds drag to fourth quarter GDP and introduces downside risk to the near-term outlook.\n\nLabor markets: Excluding the shutdown, declining government employment may create a headwind for labor markets in the fourth quarter of 2025. Roughly 150,000 federal employees opted into the Deferred Resignation Program to be put on administrative leave through September 30, 2025, after which they would voluntarily separate from the federal government. Thus, the employment report for October could show a decline in total payroll employment unless these employees had their resignation date postponed, were recalled from administrative leave upon agency reconsideration of staffing needs, or had found replacement jobs. The drag on job growth, however, could be mitigated to the extent that employees found other employment.\n\nAside from the government sector, Treasury is monitoring private-sector labor market developments closely. Although employment growth slowed in the second and third quarters of 2025, data do not indicate the slower growth is a result of soft GDP growth or weakening aggregate demand. Rather, labor supply and labor demand appear to have softened at the same time, leading to soft hiring without a sharp rise in unemployment. This is likely due to a lower breakeven rate of payroll job growth given the sharp drop in population growth that accompanied the Administration’s enforcement of immigration law.\n\nIndeed, labor markets appear to remain in balance as labor demand has softened with easing supply. Since early 2022, the private sector hires rate has trended lower and was 3.5 percent as of August 2025, comparable to the slow recovery from the 2007 to 2009 recession. Even so, layoff rates also remain low with the private-sector layoff and discharges rate at just 1.2 percent in August 2025, below the 1.6 percent average from 2001 to 2019, just before the pandemic. With modest hiring but low layoff rates, firms appear to be shedding labor via attrition and planning on productivity to drive output growth. Further supporting for the continued balance in the labor market at a lower breakeven rate is the stable, low levels of initial and continuing jobless claims.\n\nEnergy prices and geopolitical uncertainty: Geopolitical uncertainty, such as the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine, continues to add upside risk to the medium-term inflation outlook. Energy prices are one of the most volatile categories of inflation, with geopolitical events leading to large swings in the energy prices. For example, the CPI for gasoline rose 3.7 percent (15.9 percent at an annual rate) from June to September, accounting for over 10 percent of quarterly CPI inflation. High energy prices eventually feed through to other consumer goods and services, such as food (through fertilizer and fuel for farming equipment) and airfares.\n\nArtificial intelligence: Firms’ continued investment in artificial intelligence has significant potential to be a catalyst for productivity and economic growth—particularly for efficiency gains in service-sector industries where productivity growth historically has been slower than manufacturing industries. However, the timeline for when such boosts are realized, as well as the magnitude of said impetus, is still uncertain. If the integration of artificial intelligence boosts growth as a standard technology improvements, the productivity growth could return to historical norms after several years of above-trend growth. On the other hand, artificial intelligence could prove transformational and permanently upshift the path of productivity as it enables workers to build skills and human capital faster than in the past.\n\nArtificial intelligence also could have disruptive impacts on the economy and labor markets as businesses and individuals integrate it or fail to. Firms that are slow to adapt to the technology could find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, as could workers that delay incorporating artificial intelligence to improve their skills growth and productivity.\n\nThus far in President Trump’s second term, the Administration has successfully stewarded major fiscal legislation to prevent a historic tax increase, and it continues to seek further cuts to federal spending and incentivize productive business investment. Ongoing trade negotiations are transforming trade relationships, which will put American citizens first and prevent other countries from taking advantage of the openness of our economy. Moreover, supply-side policies, deregulation, and other reforms will protect the American consumer from high inflation, supply-chain disruptions, and the destabilizing potential of geo-political strife while freeing up investment funds for more productive uses and encouraging a significant increase in domestic energy production. In just a short six months, the Administration has made extensive progress to enact an agenda that will bring prosperity to all Americans.\n\nAverage Monthly Change(thousands)\n\n2025Q2\n\n2025Jul & Aug\n\nCY2024\n\n55\n\n51\n\n168\n\nPrivate Sector\n\n58\n\n58\n\n130\n\nGovernment\n\n-4\n\n-7\n\n38\n\nMonthly Average\n\n2025Q2\n\n2025Jul & Aug\n\nCY2024\n\n4.2\n\n4.3\n\n4.0\n\n62.4\n\n62.3\n\n62.6\n\nPrime-Age (Ages 25 to 54)\n\n83.5\n\n83.6\n\n83.6\n\nMonthly Average\n\n2025Q2\n\n2025Jul & Aug\n\nCY2024\n\n7.5\n\n7.2\n\n7.8\n\nVacancies per Unemployed Person\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nSources.

    "Statements & Remarks\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen on International Priorities to The Chicago Council on Global Affairs\nApril 5, 2021\nAmerica is strongest when we engage with the world.\n\nWhen I was born, the United States was still recovering from the Great Depression and World War II. These tragedies cost countless lives; too many families lost nearly everything. But from the devastation we learned an invaluable lesson: the United States must not go it alone.\n\nIn the aftermath of the destruction, the United States built strong political and security alliances that have helped keep our country safe and helped our economies flourish. We created global institutions, such as the United Nations, and financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, to reduce economic conflict and address global poverty. With strong U.S. leadership—and working together with our allies—we contained communism and created a dynamic world economy and growing markets for U.S. exports. America’s middle class prospered. Millions across the world were lifted out of poverty.\n\nBut over the years, new problems developed that were not properly addressed. In the push to grow our economies, we neglected our environment. As we embraced new technologies, we didn’t do enough to prepare our workers and our education systems for the changes underway. While we embraced trade as an engine for growth, we neglected those who did not benefit. And in the most recent period, when we might have adopted policies at home to face these issues and joined with our allies to address issues abroad, we isolated ourselves and retreated from the international order that we created.\n\nOver the last four years, we have seen firsthand what happens when America steps back from the global stage. America first must never mean America alone. For in today’s world, no country alone can suitably provide a strong and sustainable economy for its people. Over time, a lack of global leadership and engagement makes our institutions and economy vulnerable.\n\nTo make matters worse, COVID-19 struck. The virus has taken over 550 thousand American lives—our family members, our friends, our neighbors—and millions more around the world. We did not respond sufficiently last year to address the devastating health crisis at home and failed to engage early to address the crisis beyond our borders. And with the health crisis came the economic crisis. We sought to protect those most vulnerable, but millions of workers lost their jobs and all too many small businesses shuttered. Women and people of color bore the brunt of the economic hardship, exacerbating century-long inequalities that plague our society.\n\nWe can do better. We must do better.\n\nThe American people elected President Biden and Vice President Harris to tackle these challenges—the pandemic, the economic crisis, a hollowing of the middle class, systemic racism, deepening inequality, and climate change. To not just return us to life as it was before the pandemic but to build back better, creating a prosperous economy for all.\n\nCredibility abroad begins with credibility at home. How can America help lead the world out of the dual crises of pandemic and economic recession if we can’t lead ourselves out of it? It’s a fair question, and it’s why last month, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan into law.\n\nThe rescue plan is easily the largest relief package since the Great Depression. It includes powerful measures—rental assistance, unemployment insurance, direct payments—to help Americans make it to the other side of this crisis. And this package is designed not only to help our economy survive the scars of the pandemic, but to create a foundation for our economy to thrive.\n\nThe work has already begun. In less than four weeks, this administration issued more than 130 million vital relief payments to individuals and families. We provided more than 100 million vaccine shots in just 58 days.\n\nBut we have more to do. Last week, President Biden outlined a plan to Rebuild America, creating a more sustainable and more resilient economy with a 21st century infrastructure. The plan will fix America’s crumbling highways and bridges; upgrade ports, airports, and transit systems; build a renewed electric grid; deliver high-speed broadband to all Americans; and invest in basic research and science. It proposes affordable and accessible caretaking options for older Americans and our nation’s children, and an education system that trains our workers to thrive in the modern global economy.\n\nBeyond our borders, as the pandemic has made clearer than ever before, the global community is in this together. We will fare better if we work together and support each other.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to restoring U.S. leadership in the multilateral system to help make the world economy stronger and advance American interests. The United States needs to have a strong presence in global markets on a level playing field. We will cooperate with willing partners to protect and enforce a rules-based order. Our economic relationship with China, like our broader relationship with China, will be competitive where it should be, collaborative where it can be, and adversarial where it must be.\n\nWe will defend democracy and the human rights of all people—of women and girls, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people of every race, ethnic background, and religion—to help ensure that those rights are protected at home and abroad. In all our international engagements, President Biden and I will stand up for the American people and American business—as well as these core values that define America.\n\nI would like to spend time today discussing three key objectives that guide our economic engagement with the rest of the world, which I believe are necessary to help realize the vision of our nation.\n\nFor the United States to prosper, our neighbors too must prosper. In the modern world, recession, instability, and crime abroad find ways to wash upon our shore. Strong and stable economies abroad make us safer. We will benefit if countries can maintain or create economic, social, and political conditions favorable to an open society. We will benefit if individuals around the world can pursue their aspirations, regardless of conditions of birth, and if women have truly equal rights and opportunity to be included in the economy. We will benefit if people—while retaining cultural differences—share core values of free speech, free exercise of religion, and respect for diversity.\n\nOf course, stronger growth abroad also means a stronger economy here at home. As other economies prosper, demand for U.S. exports of goods and service increase, creating jobs. When developing countries are economically successful, their growing populations and rising living standards mean a higher consumer base for the United States. In 1990, 40 percent of U.S. exports went to emerging economies. By 2020, it was 60 percent. This demand for American products creates U.S. jobs that pay better. Studies have shown that women, in particular, could earn as much as 20 percent more in these export-based jobs.\n\nAt the time of the global financial crisis in 2008, we learned that an interconnected economy brings vulnerabilities. Post-crisis reforms have strengthened global banks and reduced systemic risks, but vulnerabilities, particularly in the nonbank financial sector, remain. So, as we pursue a stronger world economy, we must also pay attention to existing financial stability risks and new risks that may arise. To do so, rather than retreat, we must closely coordinate with our partners. We should aim to mitigate risks and promote a sound financial system at home and abroad, so that Americans have steady access to the finance needed to build back better—money to start a new business, to buy a home, and to create wealth for themselves and their children.\n\nUnless we act now, the world is susceptible to the emergence of a deepening global divergence between rich and poor countries. This threat, which has never been more pressing, will likely result from divergent capabilities to contain the virus and bring about economic recovery.\n\nLike the United States, rich countries and some large emerging markets have had the means to support their economies while they pursue a health solution. And, like the United States, they have gained access to vaccination. Of course, it is too early for advanced economies to declare victory. I am urging our partners to continue a strong fiscal effort and avoid withdrawing support too early, to promote a strong recovery and help avoid the emergence of global imbalances.\n\nMany middle and low-income countries are in a different place, lacking the finance to support their economies and people during COVID-19 and constrained in their wherewithal to obtain vaccines.\n\nThe result will likely be a deeper and longer-lasting crisis, with mounting problems of indebtedness, more entrenched poverty, and growing inequality. Their crises will push as many as 150 million into extreme poverty this year, reversing the trends of the last two decades, with women, youth, low-skilled and informal workers particularly hard hit. Moreover, an additional 120 million people became acutely food insecure in 2020, and that trend could worsen.\n\nThis would be a profound economic tragedy for those countries, one we should care about. But, that’s obvious. What’s less obvious—but equally true—is that this divergence would also be a problem for America. With few exceptions, stable and prosperous economies tend to be less of a security threat to the United Sates. And, the human crisis of refugees and migrants will only be solved if we have stable and secure growth in the rest of the world.\n\nSo how do we help the poorest countries get through this crisis?\n\nOur first task must clearly be stopping the virus by ensuring that vaccinations, testing, and therapeutics are available as widely as possible. Low-income countries risk falling to the back of the line and may not achieve widespread vaccine coverage until 2023 or 2024 at the current pace. More work and funding are needed to secure vaccine purchases, address manufacturing shortages, and finance and facilitate the domestic rollout in low-income countries.\n\nWe also need to help lessen the economic pain in low-income countries during a protracted recovery period and use this opportunity—as we are doing in the United States—to facilitate structural transformations to more inclusive and sustainable economies. The IMF and the World Bank have already played an important role on this front, and we are working to strengthen their ability to support the poorest countries. We have created a new multilateral framework to help low-income countries address unsustainable debt burdens. And at the IMF, we are working to issue $650 billion in new Special Drawing Rights, an international reserve asset, that will increase buffers for all IMF members and give low-income countries the additional liquidity for greater spending on vaccines and healthcare.\n\nEmbedded in recovery efforts, we have an interest in helping countries pursue sustainable and inclusive growth and strengthen long-term resilience. Our response will not be successful if we end up just where we were before.\n\nA personal objective of mine is to focus our international engagements on fostering full legal rights and greater economic and education opportunities for women and girls, given the clear evidence that this will support inclusive economic growth more broadly. Speaking from my own experience, we need to do better at reducing barriers for women’s economic empowerment, even unconscious ones, in nearly every country in the world, including the United States.\n\nThe most evident, immediate example is the need to address global health risks. COVID-19 has clearly shown that pandemic responses require global cooperation. We are working with our partners to enhance pandemic preparedness against future shocks. We need to learn lessons from this pandemic to be better prepared to stop future contagious diseases before they become full-scale pandemics.\n\nAnother global challenge we face is how to adapt to technological change, which has brought significant benefits but contributed to greater inequality. Digitalization is the latest technological advance that provides an opportunity to raise productivity and increase connectivity, both at home and globally. Even just a year ago, I never thought that I would regularly be joining meetings with colleagues in London, Delhi, Sydney, and everywhere in between from the comfort of my office in Treasury. But the digital divide has also exacerbated inequality, and digitalization has raised concerns about privacy, illicit activity, and threats of surveillance and cybersecurity attacks from our adversaries. I will be working domestically and closely with our allies to promote innovation in digital finance, in the interest of cheap, instantaneous, and reliable commercial and financial transactions, but also to ensure that we modernize our legal and regulatory frameworks to take account of the risks and threats inherent in the use of these new technologies.\n\nAnother consequence of an interconnected world has been a thirty-year race to the bottom on corporate tax rates. Competitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids. It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises, and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government. President Biden’s proposals announced last week call for bold domestic action, including to raise the U.S. minimum tax rate, and renewed international engagement, recognizing that it is important to work with other countries to end the pressures of tax competition and corporate tax base erosion. We are working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom. Together we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth, and prosperity.\n\nLet me end by discussing the biggest long-term threat the world faces: climate change. After sitting on the sidelines for four years, the United States is committed to doing its part. We have a narrow moment to pursue action at home and abroad to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of that crisis and to seize the opportunity that tackling climate change presents.\nPresident Biden has released a plan to combat climate change, including through rejoining the Paris Agreement, investing in sustainable infrastructure, and creating new green jobs. He has committed to release an ambitious strategy this year to outline U.S. domestic greenhouse gas targets that are consistent with our work internationally.\n\nDomestic action must go hand in hand with U.S. international leadership, aimed at significantly enhancing global action. To this end, Treasury is working closely with our international partners and international organizations to implement ambitious emissions reduction measures, protect critical ecosystems, build resilience against the impacts of climate change, and promote the flow of capital toward climate-aligned investments and away from carbon-intensive investments. We are also working to ensure that climate risk is integrated into the financial system so that financial institutions, regulators, and investors can make informed decisions. I am pleased that Treasury is co-chairing a newly launched G20 sustainable finance working group, where finance ministries and central banks will work together to identify mechanisms for promoting green investments and accelerating transition to a net-zero economy.\n\nAs I prepare to meet with my colleagues from around the world this week at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings, I find myself thinking back to the policymakers who gathered in Bretton Woods a year before I was born to define our post-war order. Though it was a different time, I empathize with the enormous weight they faced; the pressure to come together after a global catastrophe in building an enduring and interconnected system aimed at promoting peace and prosperity throughout the world. Our current juncture is no less significant—what we do in the coming months and years will have profound impacts on the trajectory of our country and on the global economic order.\n\nOf course, there are key differences from the post-war era. Maybe most noticeably, I will be joined later this week by other female finance ministers, central bank governors, and heads of international financial institutions—not enough, but a start—as well as diverse representatives from all corners of the globe. In our interconnected and digital world, and considering the pandemic, I will be logging onto a computer to join these meetings, not trekking to a mountain resort in New Hampshire.\n\nYet, the most important difference today is a fundamental recognition that our policies at home and abroad must be designed to be inclusive, tackle inequality, and respect our environment. In this context, I will use the Spring Meetings this week to: advance discussions on climate change; press our partners to do their part to support a strong global economic recovery; strengthen tools to improve vaccine access and financing for the world’s poorest countries; and increase the focus on inequality, including for vulnerable populations and women and girls.\n\nI’m honored to serve the American people once again. To listen to the underrepresented. To be bold in action. And to cooperate with our global partners to solve the challenges we face together in building the next century of prosperity.\n\n###",
    "Press Releases\nTreasury Sanctions Public Ministry of Nicaragua and Nine Government Officials Following Sham November Elections\nNovember 15, 2021\nWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated the Public Ministry of Nicaragua (Ministerio Publico de Nicaragua) as well as nine officials of the Government of Nicaragua in response to the sham national elections orchestrated by President Daniel Ortega (Ortega) and Vice President Rosario Murillo (Murillo). This action targets those who are repressing Nicaraguans for exercising their human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nBetween October 2020 and June 2021, the Nicaraguan National Assembly, controlled by Ortega and Murillo, approved six laws that facilitated the government’s repression against the opposition and eliminated its chances in the November 2021 elections. Several officials designated in today’s action were appointed to their government positions by Ortega and are key supporters of the regime and its anti-democratic policies; the officials designated today also include multiple persons implicated in violence against peaceful protestors during Nicaragua’s 2018 demonstrations.\n\nAs President Biden stated, President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Murillo orchestrated a pantomime election that was neither free nor fair, and most certainly not democratic. The unjust imprisonment of nearly 40 opposition figures since May, including seven potential presidential candidates, and the blocking of political parties from participation rigged the outcome well before election day.\n\n“The Ortega regime is using laws and institutions to detain members of the political opposition and deprive Nicaraguans from the right to vote,” said Office of Foreign Assets Control Director Andrea M. Gacki. “The United States is sending an unequivocal message to President Ortega, Vice President Murillo, and their inner circle that we stand with the Nicaraguan people in their calls for reform and a return to democracy.”\n\nToday’s action, taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13851, “Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Nicaragua,” and the Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018 (NHRAA), now known as the Nicaragua Investment Conditionality Act of 2018 (NICA), is intended to highlight the anti-democratic actions that the Ortega regime has undertaken to alter and corrupt the election process in Nicaragua and solidify the power of Ortega, Murillo and their inner circle.\n\nThe Public Ministry of Nicaragua is the federal public prosecutor’s office and is designated for being responsible for or complicit in, or for having directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Nicaragua. Relying on Nicaraguan law, including Law 1055, the Public Ministry has unjustly arrested and investigated presidential candidates and prevented them from running for office, thereby undermining democracy in Nicaragua. Law 1055 prohibits from public office anyone determined to be “traitors,” such as those advocating “foreign interference” in Nicaragua or other actions deemed to be undermining Nicaraguan sovereignty. In June 2021, the Public Ministry used Law 1055 and requested that leading opposition presidential candidate Cristiana Chamorro, whom it was investigating on groundless charges relating to “the crimes of laundering, forgery of official documents, and abusive management,” be disqualified from the electoral process. The Public Ministry also initiated investigations or filed charges against leading presidential candidates Arturo Cruz, Felix Maradiaga, Juan Sebastian Chamorro, and Miguel Mora, all of whom were detained since June of this year in the run-up to the sham November elections. The Public Ministry is also responsible for the arrest of nearly 40 individuals since late May, including leaders of civil society, the private sector, students, and journalists.\n\nLuis Angel Montenegro Espinoza (Montenegro) was designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007. As the Superintendent of the Superintendency of Banks and Other Financial Institutions (SIBOIF), Montenegro ordered banks to comply with a request from the Public Ministry to audit and turn over financial information on 13 senior executives and businessmen in accordance with Law 1055 due to being the subject of an investigation. Additionally, in April 2020, SIBOIF issued regulations implementing the February 2020 amendments to the Law for the Protection of Consumers and Users, which forbids banks in Nicaragua, without a reason recognized by Nicaraguan law, from refusing financial services to customers, including OFAC-designated persons.\n\nJose Adrian Chavarria Montenegro (Chavarria) is the Nicaraguan Vice Minister of Finance and Public Credit and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007. Chavarria replaced, as a board member of the National Electric Transmission Company, U.S.-designated Ivan Adolfo Acosta Montalvan, who arranged significant financial support to the Ortega regime.\n\nRodolfo Francisco Lopez Gutierrez is the Managing Director of the Electric Distributor of the North (DISNORTE) and Electric Distributor of the South (DISSUR) and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007.\n\nJose Antonio Castaneda Mendez is the President of Nicaraguan Institute of Energy and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007.\n\nMohamed Farrara Lashtar (Lashtar) is the Nicaraguan Ambassador to Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Lashtar is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007.\n\nSalvador Mansell Castrillo is the Nicaraguan Minister of Energy and Mines and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007.\n\nSadrach Zeledon Rocha (Zeledon) is the Mayor of the Nicaraguan city of Matagalpa and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007. Zeledon contributed to the violence inflicted against demonstrations by Nicaraguan citizens that began in April 2018. He was connected to the actions of paramilitary forces, the pro-Ortega Police, and shock groups that engaged in serious abuses against protestors.\n\nLeonidas Centeno Rivera (Centeno) is the Mayor of Jinotega and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007. Centeno is directly linked to instances of repression in Jinotega during the 2018 protests. In particular, attacks with heavy weaponry carried out by paramilitary members killed four individuals, and members of Centeno’s mayoral office staff actively participated in the repression of protestors.\n\nFrancisco Ramon Valenzuela Blandon (Valenzuela) is the Mayor of Esteli and is designated for being an official of the Government of Nicaragua or for having served as an official of the Government of Nicaragua at any time on or after January 10, 2007. Valenzuela’s office was ordered to position snipers to target demonstrators during the protests of 2018.\n\nAs a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of these persons that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more in the aggregate by one or more of such persons are also blocked. OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all dealings by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of blocked or designated persons.\n\nThe sanctions imposed today are not intended to be permanent but are issued to encourage a positive change of behavior by the identified persons and the authoritarian regime they support. The United States makes clear that the removal of sanctions may be available for individuals and entities designated pursuant to E.O. 13851 and the NHRAA who take concrete and meaningful actions to promote democracy and the rule of law in Nicaragua.\n\nView identifying information on the entity and individuals designated today.\n\n###",

    "Readouts\nREADOUT: At Strategic Dialogue on Illicit Finance, United States and Mexico Agree to Work on Anti-Corruption, Revitalize Illicit Finance Cooperation\nMay 13, 2022\nMEXICO CITY – The United States and Mexico committed to establish a working group on anti-corruption, focused primarily on a high-level strategic response to public corruption and in line with current Treasury efforts and the Biden Administration’s December 2021 “U.S. Strategy on Countering Corruption.” In May 2022, delegations from the United States and Mexico convened the Strategic Dialogue on Illicit Finance (SDIF) to advance anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) goals established under the U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework. In support of the U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework, officials agreed to continue expanding information-sharing to bolster bilateral efforts to counter illicit finance.\n\nAssistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes Elizabeth Rosenberg co-chaired the meeting with Mexico’s Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) Director Pablo Gomez Alvarez.  The U.S. delegation to the SDIF included Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Acting Director Himamauli Das, representatives from the Department of Justice, Internal Revenue Service, and other U.S. government agencies.  Mexico has been one of the United States’ closest partners in combatting illicit finance and the dialogue, first established in 2014, has been a key bilateral operational forum for law enforcement and AML supervisory and policy officials. This was the first in-person SDIF since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAt the dialogue, participants discussed how to move forward on major issue areas such as narcotics smuggling, evolving illicit finance threats, human smuggling and trafficking, corruption, and virtual assets. Assistant Secretary Rosenberg reaffirmed Treasury’s commitment to work with Mexican partners to target the financial networks of transnational criminal organizations and corrupt individuals.  Officials also agreed to revitalize joint work to target human traffickers and trade-based money launderers given the threat they pose to both countries.",
    "Press Releases\nTreasury Sanctions Senior Liberian Government Officials for Public Corruption\nAugust 15, 2022\nWASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Liberian government officials Nathaniel McGill, Sayma Syrenius Cephus, and Bill Twehway for their involvement in ongoing public corruption in Liberia. These officials are designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world.\n\n“Through their corruption these officials have undermined democracy in Liberia for their own personal benefit,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. “Treasury’s designations today demonstrate that the United States remains committed to holding corrupt actors accountable and to the continued support of the Liberian people.”\n\nCorruption has long undermined Liberia’s democracy and its economy, robbing the Liberian people of funds for public services, empowering illicit actors, degrading the business environment, and damaging the rule of law and effective governance in the country. Corruption also contributes to diminished confidence in government and public perception of impunity for those with power. These designations reaffirm the commitment of the United States to hold corrupt actors accountable. The United States is a proud and dedicated partner and friend of Liberia and stands with the people of Liberia in support of democracy and the rule of law and will continue to promote accountability for corrupt actors, regardless of their position or political affiliation. The United States is also committed to working with the people and Government of Liberia to elevate countering corruption as a priority, including by bolstering public sector anti-corruption capacity, and reviewing and re-evaluating criteria for bilateral and multilateral assistance, including around transparency and accountability. Holding corrupt actors accountable and bolstering anti-corruption efforts are both consistent with, and reflects our commitment to implementing, the United States Strategy on Countering Corruption.\n\nNathaniel McGill (McGill) is Minister of State for Presidential Affairs and Chief of Staff to President George Weah. During his tenure in government, McGill has bribed business owners, received bribes from potential investors, and accepted kickbacks for steering contracts to companies in which he has an interest. McGill has manipulated public procurement processes in order to award multi-million dollar contracts to companies in which he has ownership, including by abusing emergency procurement processes to rig contract bids. McGill is credibly accused of involvement in a wide range of other corrupt schemes including soliciting bribes from government office seekers and misappropriating government assets for his personal gain. He has used government funds allocated to other Liberian government institutions to run his own projects, made off-the-books payments in cash to senior government leaders, and organized warlords to threaten political rivals. McGill has received an unjustified stipend from various Liberian government institutions and used his position to prevent his misappropriation from being discovered. McGill regularly distributes thousands of dollars in undocumented cash to other government officials for government and non-government activities.\n\nMcGill is being designated for being a foreign person who is a current government official who is responsible for or complicit in, or who has directly or indirectly engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nSayma Syrenius Cephus (Cephus) is the current Solicitor General and Chief Prosecutor of Liberia. Cephus has developed close relationships with suspects of criminal investigations and has received bribes from individuals in exchange for having their cases dropped. Cephus has worked behind the scenes to establish arrangements with subjects of money laundering investigations to cease investigations in order to personally benefit financially. He shields money launderers and helps clear them through the court system and has intimidated other prosecutors in an attempt to quash investigations. Cephus has also utilized his position to hinder investigations and block the prosecution of corruption cases involving members of the government. Cephus has been accused of tampering with and purposefully withholding evidence in cases involving members of opposition political parties to ensure conviction.\n\nCephus is being designated for being a foreign person who is a current government official who is responsible for or complicit in, or who has directly or indirectly engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nBill Twehway (Twehway) is the current Managing Director of the National Port Authority (NPA). Twehway orchestrated the diversion of $1.5 million in vessel storage fee funds from the NPA into a private account. Twehway secretly formed a private company to which, through his position at the NPA, he later unilaterally awarded a contract for loading and unloading cargo at the Port of Buchanan. The contract was awarded to the company less than a month after its founding. Twehway and others used family members to obfuscate their own involvement in the company while still benefitting financially from the company.\n\nTwehway is being designated for being a foreign person who is a current government official who is responsible for or complicit in, or has directly or indirectly engaged in, corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, the expropriation of private assets for personal gain, corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources, or bribery.\n\nAs a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of these targets that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons must be blocked and reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all dealings by U.S. persons or within the United States (including transactions transiting the United States) that involve any property or interests in property of blocked or designated persons.\n\nIn addition, persons that engage in certain transactions with the individuals and entities designated today may themselves be exposed to sanctions or subject to an enforcement action. Furthermore, unless an exception applies, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates a significant transaction for any of the individuals or entities designated today could be subject to U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.\n\nBuilding upon the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, E.O. 13818 was issued on December 20, 2017, in recognition that the prevalence of human rights abuse and corruption that have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States, had reached such scope and gravity as to threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; and undermine economic markets. The United States seeks to impose tangible and significant consequences on those who commit serious human rights abuse or engage in corruption, as well as to protect the financial system of the United States from abuse by these same persons.\n\nIdentifying information on the individuals designated today.\n\n###",

    "Statements & Remarks\nJoint IMFC and Development Committee Statement by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen\nApril 12, 2023\nNotwithstanding a difficult global economic environment, our collective efforts in addressing today’s challenges provide me with a sense of optimism.  More than a year since the invasion, Russia’s war against Ukraine remains the biggest impediment to global economic growth, and we continue to grapple with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, worsening impacts of climate change, and the consequences of fragility, conflict, and violence.  These challenges inflict the highest relative cost on low- and middle-income countries, which are already burdened by heightened debt vulnerabilities.  In such trying times, we rely on the IMF and World Bank to help countries respond to shocks through sound policy advice, technical assistance, and financing.  This is why the multilateral development bank (MDB) evolution agenda is one of my top priorities.  Change at the MDBs, starting with the World Bank, is needed to equip these institutions to respond to the increasing frequency, scope, and complexity of global challenges with sufficient speed and scale.\n\nCollaboration between the World Bank and IMF on Ukraine demonstrates the critical role these institutions play in anchoring the international community’s response to shocks.  The World Bank Group has provided a platform through which the international community, including the United States, has mobilized donor financial support of over $20 billion in emergency financing for the public and private sector in Ukraine.  And, we welcome the IMF moving forward with a $15.6 billion program to bolster economic and financial stability and strengthen structural reforms, including on economic governance and anti-corruption.  The United States stands by the people and the government of Ukraine as they bravely defend their country against Russia’s unjust, unlawful, and immoral war.  We are committed to continuing to provide bilateral and multilateral economic support to Ukraine to keep its government running, and, eventually, to help it rebuild.  We call on the international community to stay resolute in its support for Ukraine, and to increase and accelerate assistance to the country.\n\nIn the United States, our economy remains sound.  In response to recent stresses at a few American depository institutions, the United States took actions to stabilize the U.S. financial system and protect depositors.  The U.S. banking system is far more resilient and has a stronger foundation than before the Global Financial Crisis, and we will continue to take steps so that our financial system remains strong.  We are working with international counterparts, including the IMF and the Financial Stability Board, to monitor disruptions to global financial stability and will work with partners as warranted to prevent spillovers to the global financial system.\n\nHeightened uncertainty in the global economic environment underscores the importance of IMF macroeconomic and financial sector surveillance, policy advice, and capacity building—activities at the heart of the IMF’s core mandate.  We will look to the IMF to provide timely economic advice, as countries calibrate difficult policy choices and tradeoffs, and as they contend with elevated inflation, tighter financial conditions, and fiscal pressures.  It is also critical that the Fund execute on its core mandate with regard to assessing external imbalances and exchange rate practices.\n\nNo issue better illustrates the central role played by the IMF in responding to global challenges than addressing debt vulnerabilities in low-income and middle-income countries.  Heightened debt vulnerabilities reinforce the urgent necessity of all bilateral creditors in taking tangible actions to support debt sustainability.  To do so, we must complete the long overdue sovereign debt restructuring for Zambia and quickly provide financing assurances to Ghana.  I welcome the provision of financing assurances for Sri Lanka that allowed the IMF program to move forward, and I urge all creditors to now complete the process of debt restructuring by the first review.  I remain concerned that the Common Framework is taking too long to provide debt relief to low-income countries, and that we lack a robust process for international coordination of debt relief for middle-income countries.\n\nI call on the IMF, with appropriate support from the World Bank, to advance ongoing work to enhance debt transparency, develop guidelines on the use of collateralized debt, assist countries in improving debt management, promote more timely information-sharing of debt sustainability analyses, and develop process improvements to the Common Framework and debt restructuring for low- and middle-income countries.  I encourage the World Bank to continue to support countries in debt distress or with high risk of debt distress through its Sustainable Development Finance Policy.  I look forward to the meeting of the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable this week to make progress on these issues.  The long established and respected principle of preferred creditor status is critical to the MDBs’ ability to provide counter-cyclical support to countries, in highly concessional or grant terms, during times of crisis.  All shareholders must respect this principle.\n\nRecent shocks to the global economy have necessitated a number of important reforms to the IMF’s toolkit, including policies to temporarily raise access limits and enable the IMF to support countries facing exceptionally high uncertainty.  Support for low-income countries in the context of these shocks will be critically important, and I therefore welcome continued efforts to increase resources for the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).  The Biden Administration continues to work with our Congress to lend up to $21 billion to the PRGT and the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST).  I am encouraged by the operationalization of the RST and support continued collaboration with the World Bank on the careful design of macro-critical reforms supported by the RST.  I also welcome the recent review of the IMF’s enhanced governance framework and support measures to strengthen IMF engagement on governance and anti-corruption measures, particularly with regard to the Fund’s emergency financing.  I view the upcoming review on precautionary lending instruments as an important step toward better supporting members facing actual or potential balance of payments difficulties, and an opportunity to better incorporate political risk and governance considerations.\n\nWith regard to IMF resources, I continue to believe that overall resources remain adequate.  At the same time, the IMF needs to follow through on its commitment to a new quota formula that is both fair and simple and primarily reflects the economic size of its member countries.  The IMF should remain a quota-based institution so that it has a consistent, predictable level of resources, which facilitates its role at the center of the global financial safety net.\n\nAs global challenges threaten to reverse past development gains, the need for bold action to address them has only become clearer.  In the last six months, we have made important progress in our efforts to evolve the World Bank Group to better address 21st century threats with a refreshed mission that reflects the need to build resilience in the face of global challenges to achieve our goals to end extreme poverty and build shared prosperity.  I also welcome the efforts to incorporate global challenges into the Country Engagement Model and corporate scorecard.  I strongly support efforts to responsibly stretch the Bank’s balance sheet by lowering the equity to loan ratio and introducing a market hybrid capital pilot that would jointly generate up to $50 billion over the next ten years, as well as starting a process to remove the Statutory Lending Limit.\n\nWe have come a long way since we started this journey six months ago.  And we have more work still to do.  We must build on this important momentum with the World Bank Group preparing an ambitious workplan following the Spring Meetings, taking a staged implementation approach in which reforms are adopted and implemented on a rolling basis through to the Annual Meetings in Marrakesh.  I will leverage key forums like the G7 and the G20 and other key convenings to drive progress at the World Bank and regional development banks.  We look forward to a strong, active role from Ajay Banga to lead the World Bank during this critical moment in its history and thank David Malpass for his service and leadership during the past four years.\n\nAs we look to the IMF and World Bank to better address these challenges, it is imperative that this work continue to support low-income countries.  Low-income countries continue to face strains resulting from rising global food insecurity driven by climate change, conflict, and COVID-19-related economic disruptions that have been only exacerbated by Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine.  We welcome the IFIs scaling their efforts to address food security through the Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity, alongside the IMF’s Food Shock Window, which complement the United States’ own leading role in committing more than $13 billion since the outbreak of Russia’s war to address humanitarian and longer-term food security needs.  The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, an important part of this food security architecture, recently allocated $220 million in agricultural investment grants for projects in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia.\n\nProtecting the resources that go to these countries, including through the International Development Association (IDA), is a critical priority for the United States.  Judicious stewardship of its existing resources must be prioritized if IDA is to be well-equipped in its capacity to address current and future challenges.  IDA Management and donors should explore further measures to responsibly add to IDA’s capacity over the short and medium term, while recognizing the constraints on both IDA countries and donors. \n \nSimilarly, we must sustain our achievements to improve health security and response, especially the Pandemic Fund, which launched last year and issued its first call for proposals last month.  We must continue the important work on finance-health collaboration in the G20 with the IFIs to be better prepared for future, cross-border health threats.\n\nTo enhance our resilience to shocks and smooth the economic transition to a net-zero global economy, we must build on our efforts to address climate change adaptation and mitigation.  If we do not take strong action this decade to meet our climate goals, climate-vulnerable countries like those in the Caribbean and Pacific Islands, low-lying states, as well as a growing number of vulnerable middle-income countries, will face existential risks, as will the global economy.  This is why we must continue to mainstream climate science into economic policy.  The United States is doing its part.  We are committed to meeting our climate goals using tools such as the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  These measures are working to shift the U.S. economy along the energy transition and toward President Biden’s goal to reduce emissions 50-52 percent by 2030.  These laws, when paired with sustainable infrastructure investment in new climate-forward technologies, will promote equitable growth, the delivery of basic services, wellbeing, and resilience.  Our investments in climate-forward technologies will also bring down global prices, which will have a positive impact for all countries to meet their global climate goals.\n\nThe IFIs are key partners in the effort by national governments to address climate change, and we look forward to the public release of the Joint MDB Approach on Paris Alignment.  I welcome the World Bank Group’s work on climate, particularly climate adaptation and resilience, highlighting that helping the most vulnerable prepare for, and recover from, natural disasters is a priority.  I also welcome the World Bank’s successful launch of the Country Climate and Development Reports, which provides an avenue for collaboration with the IMF’s RST as well as other parts of the IFI system.  Climate diagnostics such as these underscore the importance of consultation as the IFIs align financial flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement and close coordination between the IMF and World Bank on climate issues.  We reaffirm the important role of the World Bank Group as a lead financier, convenor, and source of knowledge on climate change.\n\nThe Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, including the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs), strive to increase investment in infrastructure sectors critical to equitable growth and support countries’ clean energy and digital transitions.  These targeted initiatives have the potential for significant impact in supporting countries to achieve their climate goals, shore up sustainable infrastructure stock, and boost productivity and economic growth.  If we are to make transformative gains towards global climate goals, public sector investment must be paired with and help mobilize private sector investment.  I call on the World Bank Group to step up its support for quality infrastructure and the energy transition, including by engaging actively in the JETPs.\n\nFor the IMF and World Bank to deliver on all these priorities, we call for maintaining focus on governance and accountability within these institutions.  The IMF’s implementation of its Institutional Safeguards Review will be critical to bolstering the Fund’s dispute resolution processes and bolstering staff’s voice.  In addition, diversity and inclusion at the IMF and the World Bank remain vital to these institutions’ effectiveness and sustainability.  Diversity is equally as important for the Executive Boards, and I call for greater action on promoting diversity in representation on both Boards, including through greater use of targets to help address weak gender diversity at the IMF Executive Board.\n\nI thank staff and management of both institutions for their tireless work at a time when expectations and needs are high.",

    "Secretary Statements & Remarks\nRemarks by Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen at an Inter-American Development Bank Roundtable with Ministers and Private Sector Representatives\nJuly 27, 2024\nAs Prepared for Delivery\n\nThank you, President Goldfajn, for convening this roundtable, and thank you all for joining.  I am glad that we have been able to gather this group here today to discuss how businesses can support sustainable livelihoods and conservation in the Amazon and nature and biodiversity more broadly.\n\nThere is a pressing need to halt and reverse the degradation of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity in the Amazon and globally.  I was heartened to see that the rate of deforestation in the Amazon fell by half in 2023, but there is still much work to be done. This includes maintaining this positive rate of progress while recognizing that other areas important for biodiversity in Brazil, notably the Cerrado, are not seeing the same reversals.\n\nThis is so important because the loss of nature and biodiversity presents a significant economic threat.  Ecosystem services are vital to enabling sectors including agriculture, infrastructure, and tourism to thrive.  The loss of nature is also a key driver of climate change.  We cannot reach our climate goals without addressing deforestation.  But the need to address the loss of nature and biodiversity is also a significant economic opportunity. Conserving and restoring nature at scale can provide economic benefits for communities, businesses, and countries that far exceed the cost of conservation, with results ranging from higher agricultural output to reduced damage from disasters.\n\nThis morning, ministers from the Amazon region, President Goldfajn, and I met to affirm our commitment to protecting nature and biodiversity in the Amazon and to the IDB’s Amazonia Forever, which is helping support sustainable economic development in the region through financing, project preparation, and collaboration.  We are hopeful that this program will incentivize greater private sector investment in the region that supports nature.\n\nThere are many other opportunities for the private sector.  Increasing productivity in currently available agricultural areas can double agricultural production in Brazil without increasing deforestation, according to some estimates.  Businesses investing in their own operations and supply chains can reduce nature-related risks such as water availability.  Even the biodiversity of forests brings many potential business opportunities, as we have seen with the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.  And credible net-zero transition plans and investments in high-integrity carbon credits can both support nature and make economic sense.\n\nThe public sector should be enabling these opportunities.  Governments should be working to leverage domestic policy and resources to catalyze local investment, including through policies and programs in agriculture and infrastructure development.  We are doing this at home in the United States through the Inflation Reduction Act and other policies.\n\nWe are also driving investments in emerging market and developing economies, including through the multilateral development banks and multilateral climate and environment funds.  Projects like the Amazon Bioeconomy Fund, backed by the IDB and the Green Climate Fund, help financial institutions in the region mobilize investments that support nature.  And we are also engaging with asset managers, banks, and pension funds around the world to increase their awareness of new and existing blended finance and derisking tools that can facilitate their pursuit of nature-aligned investments with a reasonable risk-to-return profile.\n\nI understand the companies represented here today have significant ambition to support a thriving and sustainable Amazon region, providing sustainable livelihoods while restoring forests and preventing further deforestation.  I am confident that your commitment, ingenuity, and financing can make a difference.  Today, I very much look forward to hearing how you approach these issues and the opportunities you see and challenges you face as we progress toward shared climate and economic goals.\n\n###"
